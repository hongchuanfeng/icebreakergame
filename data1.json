You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun.

There are no shuffles, and the game is timed, but the game's pace is relaxed.\n\nHow to Play Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nSpot the patterns\n\nMahjong is a tricky puzzle game. There are so many tiles, many of which look the same but feature slight differences. Along with the need to spot these patterns, you can’t move any pieces with both sides blocked. The left or right side needs to be accessible, at least.\n\nFinding a couple of “free” tiles is the challenge here, with a tile-free being when there are no tiles on top of it. In addition, either its left or right side needs to be open. In this version of Mahjong Solitaire, you can look at the top of your screen to understand how many pairs of tiles are “free” to be matched, plus you can match the special tiles, those with a colored background, anytime.\n\nUse hints when you’re stuck\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features hints if you get stuck, but unlike some other mahjong games, it does not have a shuffle feature. The games are also timed, meaning there is some urgency to how many tiles you can match.\n\nWhen the game ends, you’ll get a score for the tiles you matched and a bonus for how far you got in the game before your time ran out.\n\nTile groups in Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features 144 tiles divided primarily into three suits. The primary suits are:\n\nDots - feature circles\nBamboo - feature lines\nCharacters - feature Chinese characters\n\nIn Mahjongg Solitaire, you’ll also notice special tiles that can be matched even without the same image. These are highlighted in blue or green.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nMahjong Solitaire is an excellent choice for both beginners and regular Mahjong enthusiasts. However, there are many other titles in our collection of Mahjong games. Other puzzle games you may like include board games such as 2048, Rummikub, and Ludo.\n\nRelease Date\n\nOctober 2016\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile). We also have the Android version.\n\nLast Updated\n\nAug 03, 2022\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact.\n\nFAQ\nIs it spelled mahjong or mahjongg?\nBoth words are correct and are used to describe the same game.\nIs Mahjongg Solitaire a difficult game?\nMahjong is generally a tricky game, but this is probably a medium-difficulty mahjong game compared with others. There are no shuffles, but you have 10 minutes and unlimited hints which balances the game nicely.\nIs Mahjong Solitaire a free game?\n\nYes, you can play Mahjong Solitaire online for free at CrazyGames.\n\nIs Mahjong good for the brain?\n\nPuzzle games are often cited as keeping the mind sharp and maintaining brain health.\n\nGameplay Video"

Each level has its own degree of difficulty.\n\nIf you choose a “green” level, you’ll be met with wider space and angles, making it possible to gain some straight momentum with your arrow. As you choose more difficult levels, you can expect more obstacles, tighter angles and more of them.\n\nSpace Waves allows you to choose any level you want to play, so you can start with the most difficult which can quickly give you a sense of the need for quick reaction times.\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nMove in a zigzag when obstacles are ahead, as this will give you the momentum of a straight line trajectory.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more casual games, check out our Casual category and browse the selection.\n\nSome casual games worth exploring include: Snow Rider 3D, Sand Tetris, World’s Hardest Game and Free GeoGuessr.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 22, 2025\n\nControls\nPC Controls\nHold the left mouse button / W / Spacebar to go up and release to go down.\nP to pause the game\nMobile Controls\n\nHold the screen to go up and release to go down.\n\nGameplay Video"

Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

Drive your go-kart, pick up weapons, and blow up other karts to win! Keep playing to level up and unlock new characters and prizes.\n\nHow to Play Smash Karts\nBattle and earn XP\n\nFace off with other players in the arena for 3 minutes of kart-smashing mayhem. The game features several maps to explore, and it is continually updated with new ones. Each public match you play will give you XP, which you can then use to level up. \n\nLeveling up will reward you with coins, hats, wheels, and character tokens. You can use character tokens in the prize machine to unlock new characters with varying rarity levels.\n\nPick up weapons\n\nDrive over the boxes containing question marks to pick up random weapons and power-ups. You’ll find anything from invincibility to missiles, machine guns, and mines to use against your opponents. Get in your kart and cause some chaos!\n\nAvailable Weapons\n\nRockets: fairly straightforward, helpful for hitting opponents in front of you.\nMachine Gun: it rapidly fires several projectiles and can take down enemies around you, as long as you are close by.\nBullets: with these, you’ll fire a series of bullets that will go straight from your position. It can be useful to fire at enemies in crowded contexts or on long, straight alleys.\nMines: you can deploy three mines that serve as a static trap for your challengers. Mines are particularly effective when placed around corners or hidden behind item boxes.\nCannonballs: using this will send four cannonballs in the direction of your choice. Cannonballs require precision to be effective, but can eliminate multiple adversaries simultaneously.\nSpiky-Go-Round: activating the spiky-go-round will add rotating balls with spikes to your vehicle, which will make any contact with opponents lethal for them.\nNuke: a very powerful missile that has a wide impact radius.\nLobgrenuke: with a lobgrenuke you are placing a TNT-like static bomb on the ground. It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items!

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

However, constant movement can work in your favor: it’s harder to hit a moving target and easier to surprise your opponent with unexpected strikes.\n\nStickman Clash is designed for one or two players, and three- and four-player modes are planned for even more chaotic fun!\n\nSurvival mode\n\nWork together to fend off waves of monsters and defend your base. Use bombs strategically to clear crowds without harming teammates.\n\nBoss Fights\n\nThese epic battles test your skills. The pickaxe-wielding boss is especially challenging, dodge its attacks and counter with well-timed bombs. Teamwork and precision are your best allies here.\n\nGame Tips\n\nStay agile: The more you move, the harder you are to hit.\n\nUse the environment: Maps come with unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nMaster timing: Especially in boss fights, precision and teamwork are key.\n\nExperiment: Try different weapons and strategies to discover what works best for you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere is plenty of action to go around, so browse our vast selection of games to continue playing.

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

They are difficult, but not impossible. Your goal is to reach the finish line, whether you can get through dangerous obstacles or not-so-dangerous ones. Any collision will likely destroy your car. Precision is key to survival, making this game ideal for anyone seeking a thrill.\n\nHow to Play Deadly Descent\n\nPrepare for the most intense, destructive races of your life in Deadly Descent.\n\nYou will be on a dirt road track or similar landscapes with nothing but speed in your control.\n\nMost of the races will leave your car completely destroyed, smashed, flipped, torn apart, catapulted off the edge, or worse. But the key is to get there first. Yes, it may sound odd, but your goal is to be the fastest in the race and survive as best you can with a banged-up car rather than suffer a fatal off-road accident.\n\nKeep your speed steady. Going fast will help you reach the finish line quickly, but it can also generate the force to destroy your car if you lose control.\n\nGive yourself enough time to brake and navigate obstacles such as smashing levers, spiked rolling crushers, sporadic crates, and more. If your car flips, you can survive if it gets banged up, no problem. But if it hits any of these objects at full force, you are likely not going to make it out of the round in one piece.\n\nEach round offers new obstacles to overcome, challenging your reflexes and strategy as you push your car to the limit.\n\nFeatures\nDestructible vehicles\nRefined physics and detailed graphics\nUnique tracks and endless challenges\nThe experience is highly realistic while remaining optimized to run smoothly on both phones and computers.\nMore Games Like This\n\nSatiate your need for speed with a few more driving games from our vast selection. If you want to change vehicles, Moto X3M is one of our most popular. Get back in the car in Drift Hunters, another car game where speeding is nearly required. If you're in the mood for a classic, try Polytrack.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 14, 2025\n\nControls\n\nPC Controls\n\nWASD / arrow keys = control the car\nC = change camera view\n\nMobile Controls\n\nUse the on-screen buttons and on-screen steering wheel to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nCan you drive with a banged up car in Deadly Descent?\n\nYes, you can drive with a banged-up car in Deadly Descent.

You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down. There is a very generous reward system that incentivizes players to keep coming back, and the community in the rooms is constantly rotating, which makes each room a completely new social adventure.\n\nGameplay Video"

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

Put your brain to the test and see how far you get!\n\nHow to Play Bloxorz\n\nUse your arrow keys to move the block correctly through the level and into the hole. The goal sounds simple, but Bloxorz is a challenging brain game that gets trickier and more mind-boggling as you progress. There are 33 levels in total.\n\nAs the levels get tougher, new pieces of the puzzle are added to increase the difficulty. There are switches, special tiles, multiple blocks and various ways in which they are used to add complexity to the puzzle.\n\nWhat are the Different Switches and Tiles?\n\nThere are 3 types of switch in Bloxorz. You have the circle switch that works when you land on it in any fashion, this is also referred to as a “soft” switch. X-shaped switches require you to land upright to activate. The third switch type looks like parentheses () and teleports your block to different locations, splitting it into two smaller blocks in the process.\n\nThere are also orange tiles which are more fragile than regular tiles. These will fall through if you try to stand up vertically on them.\n\nWant Another Logic Challenge?\n\nAs well as being a tricky brain game, Bloxorz is an old-school classic from the Flash gaming era, lovingly restored through Ruffle emulation.

The only way out is to problem-solve your way to freedom by solving riddles using colors, paints, and painting tools that can be found throughout the room. Each clue will lead to the next, until finally, your colorful journey leads you to an exit.\n\nHow to Play Paint Room Escape\n\nIn Paint Room Escape, your objective is to unlock doors by solving color-based puzzles. One of the first tasks is to paint the colorless door using hints scattered throughout the room. Search for items like palettes and pencil holders and get guided into selecting the correct colors. For example, one puzzle requires painting a door with specific color patterns by observing how circles and squares are divided on a palette. As you progress, different combinations of colors help you unlock new areas and doors, with red and yellow paint being crucial early on.\n\nAs you move through the rooms, you will come across more complex puzzles. In one scenario, you must rotate color samples and match a sequence of pale blue to dark blue shades. You'll also encounter digit-based locks, like a door that requires entering a secret code to unlock.\n\nCompleting these challenges rewards you with items such as paint tubes, allowing you to progress by filling in corresponding door sections. New color clues emerge as you rinse objects in water, revealing hidden numbers and hints for further puzzles.\n\nManipulating various tools, such as temperature controls and stencils, adds even more challenging layers of complexity. At one point, you must adjust the temperature to paint the door a certain color, then adjust it once more to switch to another color.\n\nOne of the final challenges involves arranging pencils, rotating objects, and solving shape-based puzzles to activate switches and unlock the exit door. Mixing colors like blue and yellow to create green and using a screwdriver to access hidden compartments are essential steps to achieving your ultimate creative goal—escape by color!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more puzzle game fun?

Use your chess pieces' unique abilities to navigate through each stage and reach the king.\n\nHow to Play Chessformer\nChess piece movements\n\nChessformer utilizes the movement principles of chess pieces to overcome various challenges on a 2D grid. That means rooks move only in straight lines, bishops only move diagonally, etc. The difference is that you're moving sideways, so moving your piece up the board also causes it to fall.\n\nTricky challenges\n\nChessformer gives you an easy introduction to how the game works, with the first few levels being quite simple. However, the difficulty quickly increases. You'll have to get your problem-solving cap on and think creatively to progress through the levels.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nChessformer isn't your typical chess game. If you want to play chess, head to our chess games, where you'll find plenty more. For similar classic puzzle games, check out titles like Classic Solitaire, Mahjongg, Uno Online, and Sudoku.\n\nFeatures\nClever mechanics based on chess pieces\nMovement confined to a chessboard grid\n24 challenging levels put your mind to work\nSatisfying visuals, sounds, and music\nRelease Date\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDeveloper\n\nRobert Alvarez developed this game.\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nSteam\nLast Updated\n\nMar 06, 2023\n\nControls\n\nClick (or touch) on pieces to select, then click to move them.\n\nFAQ\nHow to play Chessformer?\n\nEach piece in Chessformer follows its traditional movement rules: rooks in straight lines, bishops diagonally, and so on. The twist is that you navigate sideways, so moving a piece upward also shifts its position downward on the board.\n\nHow many levels are there in Chessformer?\n\nThere are 48 levels in Chessformer.\n\nGameplay Video",

Your character is a slime that can only move a limited number of times when off the ground. That makes certain moves more challenging, and you’ll have to plan ahead to figure out how to complete each task.\n\nLearn how to Growmi\n\nOnce you overcome the initial difficulty of thinking like a Growmi, it does get easier. If you get stuck, use the hints button in the bottom right corner to show you how to complete the challenge correctly. Once you see how it works, your skills will definitely improve.\n\nFix your mistakes\n\nEvery new area has a unique challenge to keep you on your toes, and it keeps the game engaging for you. Sometimes, you might need to restart the challenge by clicking R, or undo a previous move with U. That’s because some actions can’t be fixed without taking a step back!\n\nProgress through the game to unlock more abilities and a longer Growmi!\n\nMore puzzles to play\n\nIf you enjoy a stimulating brain-busting challenge, check out more of our puzzle games.

Search for clues around the room and look for clues that help you reach your goal of escaping.\n\nEscape Room Games\n\nDo you love a challenge? Escape rooms are great for logical, puzzle-solvers. You'll find plenty of them in our Escape Games collection. Many escape room games feature an element of horror, like House of Celestina.

Collect resources to gain experience points (XP) and level up your ship. Each level unlocks new ships and modules—offering unique abilities like mining, attacking, or boosting speed. To equip a module, simply drag it from your inventory into one of your ship’s module slots. Customizing your ship’s loadout allows you to adapt to different strategies and playstyles.\n\nTo climb the leaderboard, you’ll need to build and protect your base. Use the toolbar at the bottom of the screen to access different building types, each with its own cost and function. Make sure you’ve mined enough resources before constructing anything, then drag and drop buildings onto the map grid.\n\nDynamo: The heart of your base, powering nearby tiles when fueled. Click it or drag a resource to it to supply power.\nScorer: Generates leaderboard points over time, but only when powered by a nearby Dynamo.\nTurrets: Automatically defend your base against enemies, but require power to function.\nWalls: Strong, low-cost defenses ideal for protecting your core structures.\n\nStay alert! Other players can attack your base at any time! If your ship is destroyed, you’ll lose everything: your modules, inventory, and progress. On the flip side, defeating other players earns you valuable XP.\n\nStrategy Tips\nFocus on leveling up your ship first before building a base. A stronger ship makes resource collection faster and safer.\nExperiment with modules. You can freely swap them out to match your current objectives.\nUse the edges of the map as natural defenses for your base, but keep in mind that resources are scarcer there.\n\nMaster resource management, smart base-building, and tactical ship upgrades to become the top pilot in Voxorp!\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 28, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = move around\nHold the left mouse button on resources = mine resources\nDrag the left mouse button = drag modules from your inventory into your ship"

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Each level has its own degree of difficulty.\n\nIf you choose a “green” level, you’ll be met with wider space and angles, making it possible to gain some straight momentum with your arrow. As you choose more difficult levels, you can expect more obstacles, tighter angles and more of them.\n\nSpace Waves allows you to choose any level you want to play, so you can start with the most difficult which can quickly give you a sense of the need for quick reaction times.\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nMove in a zigzag when obstacles are ahead, as this will give you the momentum of a straight line trajectory.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more casual games, check out our Casual category and browse the selection.\n\nSome casual games worth exploring include: Snow Rider 3D, Sand Tetris, World’s Hardest Game and Free GeoGuessr.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 22, 2025\n\nControls\nPC Controls\nHold the left mouse button / W / Spacebar to go up and release to go down.\nP to pause the game\nMobile Controls\n\nHold the screen to go up and release to go down.\n\nGameplay Video"

Drive your go-kart, pick up weapons, and blow up other karts to win! Keep playing to level up and unlock new characters and prizes.\n\nHow to Play Smash Karts\nBattle and earn XP\n\nFace off with other players in the arena for 3 minutes of kart-smashing mayhem. The game features several maps to explore, and it is continually updated with new ones. Each public match you play will give you XP, which you can then use to level up. \n\nLeveling up will reward you with coins, hats, wheels, and character tokens. You can use character tokens in the prize machine to unlock new characters with varying rarity levels.\n\nPick up weapons\n\nDrive over the boxes containing question marks to pick up random weapons and power-ups. You’ll find anything from invincibility to missiles, machine guns, and mines to use against your opponents. Get in your kart and cause some chaos!\n\nAvailable Weapons\n\nRockets: fairly straightforward, helpful for hitting opponents in front of you.\nMachine Gun: it rapidly fires several projectiles and can take down enemies around you, as long as you are close by.\nBullets: with these, you’ll fire a series of bullets that will go straight from your position. It can be useful to fire at enemies in crowded contexts or on long, straight alleys.\nMines: you can deploy three mines that serve as a static trap for your challengers. Mines are particularly effective when placed around corners or hidden behind item boxes.\nCannonballs: using this will send four cannonballs in the direction of your choice. Cannonballs require precision to be effective, but can eliminate multiple adversaries simultaneously.\nSpiky-Go-Round: activating the spiky-go-round will add rotating balls with spikes to your vehicle, which will make any contact with opponents lethal for them.\nNuke: a very powerful missile that has a wide impact radius.\nLobgrenuke: with a lobgrenuke you are placing a TNT-like static bomb on the ground. It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items! Use your coins, character tokens, and gems to buy various in-game items.\n\nPlay in events\n\nVarious seasonal events occur throughout the year, so make sure to come back and play Smash Karts at special times of year for new content.

Explore the underwater world and its legendary fish to unlock a variety of unique characters. Your goal is to become the most excellent fisher on the planet. Get ready for surprises in every layer of the deep, as they get bigger and bigger.\n\nHow to Play Fish Orbit\n\nFish Orbit is a fast-paced fishing game where each cast takes you deeper into the ocean. Drop your line, reel in exotic catches, and unlock new characters as you work toward becoming the ultimate fisher. Every layer of the sea holds surprises, from schools of small fish to rare creatures hidden in the depths.\n\nYour goal is to cast your line as far and deep as possible. Timing is crucial. Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

(Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it.

Flying knives are generally a no-no, but in this game, they are the only way to progress to new blades and skins.\n\nSlice Master reviewed\n\nWe really enjoyed the fun tactile slicing of this game. The sounds are just perfect. I liked how the kids had to work out which mathematical operator was the best to go for at the end of the level - \"is x4 better than +60?\" Also, because you play it with just one button, it was a game that the whole family could have a go at, even from the youngest of us. In fact, our grandparents also got involved and turned out to be pretty competitive.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase\n\nHow to Play Slice Master\n\nSlice Master is a one-button game controlled by the space pad on your keyboard or the left click on your mouse. All the control lies in this one simple movement. The game has an ASMR quality, and the consistent slicing is oddly soothing to the ear.\n\nThe aim is simple: slice everything in sight: fruit, shapes, walls, furniture, and more. You can slice most things, but don’t add the white wall to your target list—it’s just a holding material for your knife.\n\nYou will get to shop along the way, using the coins accumulated to unlock sharper blades, swords, maces, and more: anything to help you slice even more!\n\nTips\nStay away from the pink spiked metal shapes. They are too strong for your knife and will take you straight back to the beginning of the round. Sometimes these can be found at the bottom of a pile of objects to slice, so be careful to lift your knife in time to avoid them\nHit the correct numeric target at the end of each level to multiply your points by the target number and boost your score.\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf casual games are your style, you can find a slew of them in our casual game category. Go for a classic like Bubble Shooter Classic or a head-scratching word teaser like Word Search.\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 31, 2024\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button or space to flip your knife into action.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I earn more points in Slice Masters?\n\nWhen you reach the end of the level, make sure you hit the numbered targets to multiply your points. The higher the number, the more points you will receive, so aim high.\n\nCan I cut the white pillar in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, the white pillar can’t be cut, but you can attach it and use it as a safety net to prevent it from hitting the ground.\n\nCan I go backwards in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, you can only go forward in Slice Masters.\n\nHow many knives can I unlock in Slice Masters?\n\nYou can unlock 9 knives in Slice Masters so keep those points coming.\n\nGameplay Video",

You control one of these weapon-wielding eggs in one of four online game modes where the aim is to shatter your opponents with bullets and bombs. It's the ultimate online egg shooting game!\n\nKids love games where they shoot other players. Whatever you think about guns this seems to always be the case. We let our children play Shell Shockers before the older rating games with guns because it's a less violent way to have fun online. In fact, they enjoyed it so much that even though they are older they still go back to play this again and again.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Shell Shockers\n\nJump into the game and select your character name, customize your egg,  and choose one of four game modes. In this game, you must work hard to protect yourself and dish out damage to opposing eggs. Try out each game mode and see if you can conquer the Shell Shockers arena. \n\nTips and tricks\nPlay tactically\nAct quickly\nCollect egg ammunition\nThink like an egg\nGame modes\nTeams\n\nJoin a team (either red or blue) and fight against the enemy eggs until your team has the most kills collectively.\n\nFree For All\n\nEvery egg for themselves. If you see an egg, you shoot. Unless you want to be scrambled yourself. There is only one winner in this mode.\n\nCaptula the Spatula\n\nTwo teams battle for control of the spatula. The team with the spatula earns points for kills, but these can be lost if the player holding the spatula dies.\n\nKing of the Coop\n\nKing of the Coop was added in December 2021 with a host of cosmetic items and a new map. Two teams battle to capture a defined area known as the coop. The players on the winning team get 250 golden eggs each!\n\nWeapons\n\nThere are seven main weapon types in Shell Shockers. Each weapon has its advantages and drawbacks. If you have eggcellent aim, a weapon like the Crackshot would be great. If you’re more of a spray-and-pray type, try out the Whipper. The complete weapon list for Shell Shockers is:\n\nEggK-47 - classic medium-range automatic\nScrambler - high-damage shotgun\nFree Ranger - semi-automatic sniper rifle\nRPEGG - huge damage RPG\nWhipper - close to medium range rapid-fire rifle\nCrackshot - bolt-action sniper rifle\nTriHard - accurate medium-range burst-fire rifle\n\nAdditionally, each player has an additional gun and can pick up grenades from the map.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe game uses Golden Eggs as currency; you can use them to upgrade the way your character appears in the game or the weapons it uses. Mind you, using the Golden Eggs in the shop won’t allow you to buy items that give you an advantage during combat.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more online shooting games, check out our multiplayer io games and browse the selection, which includes the highly popular Agar io.\n\nIf you are looking for something totally different, consider trying Bubble Shooter or 2048.\n\nFeatures\nFast-paced FPS gameplay\nA unique theme centered around eggs\nVarious weapons and game modes \nEgg customization and a shop for more items\nDeveloper\n\nShell Shockers is developed by Blue Wizard Digital (formerly known as the Egg and Dairy Ministry of Belarus).

You race a car you've customized, on a track you might have designed yourself. This is a fast-paced, low-poly driving game featuring thrilling loops, jumps, and high-speed action where every millisecond counts.\n\nInspired by TrackMania, it challenges you to race against the clock, constantly striving to improve your time on various tracks built by you and the Polytrack community! It doesn't get any more hands-on than that.\n\nHow to Play Polytrack\n\nYou can race on the racecourses you've designed, but it's probably easier to start with the existing ones. You not only have to think about beating your own record when it comes to time, but you also need to master the craft of building for speed and precision.\n\nStart by creating your track using the game’s design tools or choosing from pre-made tracks. Customize the track with various obstacles, ramps, and curves to suit your preferences. Don't know exactly what track to build? Get help from the Polytrack community. There are plenty of forums that share design codes and customization tips.\n\nWith a built-in level editor, you can unleash your creativity by designing custom tracks. You can also export and share these tracks with others for endless racing (and design) fun.\n\nThe game will require time and patience, as you don't just go into it like other driving games, with your foot on the pedal and ready to rev and drift. Initially, the easiest tracks to build are straight lines, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you will have a track jumping over mountains, sending your car and score soaring.\n\nYou can also customize your vehicle by choosing a primary and secondary color, as well as the color of the car frame and rims.\n\nA series of premade tracks is available for those who want to begin practicing and getting a feel for other designs.\n\nPolyTrack Unique Features\n\nWhen selecting a track, you can see the best lap times recorded by verified players on it and measure yourself against them.\n\nOne cool feature that differentiates PolyTrack from other driving games is the opportunity to challenge opponents asynchronously, by selecting them from the leaderboard before starting the game, and seeing them as “ghosts” as you race the track. You can also challenge yourself by shaving off some decimals from your best time and then have your car “ghosted” on the track.\n\nAvailable Tracks\n\nThere are currently 15 Official tracks and 22 Community-made tracks:\n\nOfficial tracks:\n\n7 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n4 desert tracks\n\nCommunity tracks:\n\n9 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n9 desert tracks\n\nThe driving experience remains unaltered, independent of the track season: what changes is the scenery surrounding the track.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce you've mastered building your tracks, you can enjoy these other thrilling driving games: Moto X3M, where you experience high-octane motocross action with challenging courses, stunts, and exciting levels, or Drift Hunters, where you test your drifting skills in this game that features a variety of cars and tracks designed for perfecting those thrilling drifts.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 2023\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 17, 2025\n\nControls\nDriving Controls\nWASD / arrow keys = drive\nEnter / R = restart\nEditor Controls\nLeft-click = build\nRight-click + move = move camera view\nMiddle mouse-click + move = rotate camera view\nMouse-scroll = zoom in / out\nShift + mouse-scroll / ZC = height up / down\nQE = rotate camera view to the left / right\nR / Space = rotate item\nX = delete item\nT = test drive\nFAQ\nHow to play Polytrack?\n\nIn Polytrack, you race a car you customize on a track you've designed yourself.

You can challenge the CPU or play with a friend.\n\nThere are two teams, each consisting of two players. Controls guide both your players, but be warned that their actions may not coincide with exactly how you expected them to move. Slam dunks are still very possible!\n\nUse the W key to control player one and the up arrow to control player two. Fight frantically over the basketball, bouncing and spinning in the air, trying to make the shot. Whatever team scores first wins that round. The first team to reach 5 wins the game!\n\nAfter each basket, you’re transported to a new place where the court and the surroundings have changed, and physics and attire may differ, shaking up each new round with random changes!

        "detail": "Games»Casual»Speed»Snow Rider 3D\nSnow Rider 3D\nShare\nRating\n9.0\n(9,832 votes)\nReleased\nApril 2025\nLast Updated\nApril 2025\nTechnology\nHTML5 (Unity WebGL)\nPlatform\nBrowser (desktop-only)\n\nCasual\n\n1,260\n\nAvoid\n\n284\n\n3D\n\n1,243\n\nChristmas\n\n28\n\nPhysics\n\n349\n\nSkill\n\n248\n\nCollect\n\n545\n\nSpeed\n\n148\n\nSnow Rider 3D is a thrilling sled-driving casual game that delivers heart-pounding downhill action and endless winter fun. Dodge obstacles, collect gifts, and race your way through snowy slopes at high speed.\n\nHow to Play Snow Rider 3D\n\nEver wonder what it’s like to be a young Santa learning how to master the sleigh? Snow Rider 3D brings you close to that experience. You’ll find yourself speeding through snowy forests, dodging snowmen, rocky snowcaps, and other tricky obstacles: this is not exactly the easiest place to sled, but that's what makes a true pro.\n\nThe main goal is simple: don’t crash. Hitting any obstacle will shatter your sled and end your run. If you wipe out, you’ll have the option to watch an ad for a second chance, or you can start fresh, often facing a new set of challenges.\n\nYou’re scored based on your Score, Best, and Gifts collected along the way. Use smooth left and right movements to dodge obstacles, and be ready to jump over anything too large to slide past. Openings can be narrow, and timing your jumps is crucial, especially with sudden, steep drops that demand quick reflexes.\n\nGifts are scattered along your path, and collecting them will boost your score, but be warned, they're often placed dangerously close to obstacles. Only go for them if you’re confident you can grab them safely!\n\nHow to Win Snow Rider 3D\n\nIf you want to get a high score in Snow Rider 3D, focus on staying near the center of the slope to give yourself room to maneuver around obstacles. Try to make subtle moves, rather than sudden moves, as there are obstacles everywhere, and not that much space to avoid them. You should also aim to get as many gifts as possible, but the key is to know when to let them pass you by. Snow and steady wins the race in Snow Rider 3D.\n\nA few key factors lead to success:\n\nScore: Your score increases primarily with distance traveled, with some bonus points coming from gifts or performing jumps.\nGifts: The more gifts you collect, the more currency you have. This gives you the power to unlock new sleds.\nSnow Rider 3D Gamescape\n\nSnow Rider 3D is set in a winter landscape with bright white slopes and festive details, all from a first-person view with a view of the tip of a sled to guide you. The clean visuals and holiday accents give it a cozy holiday feel.\n\nBut perhaps one of the best parts of Snow Rider 3D is the sound design. You’ll hear festive sleigh bells at the start, but as you pick up speed, the sounds blur into the sound of your sled whooshing and snow crunching beneath you. In short, it's a winter wonderland.\n\nUpgrades\n\nProgression in Snow Rider 3D is limited to unlocking new sled designs with gifts. There are no power-ups or stat-based upgrades. With over 10 sleighs available, these unlocks provide benchmarks to strive towards.\n\nSnow Rider Levels\n\nThere are no levels per se in Snow Rider 3D as it is an endless loop of slope, curves, bridges, and obstacles.\n\nTips & Tricks\nLearn from your past crashes. You will only get better if you refine your reflexes and sled positioning.\nListen to audio cues like rolling snowballs, wind, or jingles. These are signals for what's to come and can help you plan your next move.\nMore Games Like This\n\nFeeling a need for speed?

Get ready to leave your mark on the asphalt, literally!\n\nHow to Play Drift Hunters\n\nYou start Drift Hunters by selecting your car and the type of ride you want to take. You can upgrade the performance, including the brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine, with superior parts. You can also finish off your car in any color and enjoy a selection of rims on the house.\n\nThe key to this game is scoring points by drifting your car. The more you drift, the more points you get, which you can then spend in the garage to fine-tune your car.\n\nRace Tracks: Drift through diverse circuits like Nishuri, Stadium, Tyshen, and more. Each track offers a unique layout with varied curves and turns, challenging your drifting skills to the max.\n\nCars: Rack up at least 8,500 points to start unlocking cars, with the top model costing over 134k points. Every drift and upgrade gets you closer to that dream ride! If you are a beginner, you might find that it is better to focus on optimizing the performance of entry-level cars before investing all your cash on a new ride.\n\nDrift Hunters available cars:\n\nBMW M3\nToyota Supra\nHonda S2000\nFord Fiesta ST\nNissan 370Z coupe\nDodge Challenger Hellcat\nNissan GTR\nPorsche 911 GT\nAnd 18 more cars...\n\nParts & Upgrades: Customize your vehicle’s performance with upgrades to brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine.\n\nTuning: Adjust your car’s fine-tuning settings, including front and rear camber, offset, brake balance, height, and brake pressure, to perfect your drift style even without additional upgrades.\n\nVisuals: Express your style by customizing the color of your car’s body and rims, and select from a range of rim designs to complete your look.\n\nEvery car you buy can be fully tuned: turbo, brakes, engine, gearbox and weight can range from \"street\" level, the lowest, to the \"pro\", which is also the most expensive. You can fully modify these values to find the best tuning for your drift performance.\n\nSome tracks allow you to keep drifting much more easily than others. The best tracks for drifting in Drift Hunters are Emashi and Forest because of their long corners and lack of too many sharp turns. The Forest track features the longest corners, allowing for the most prolonged drifts.\n\nThe longer you drift, the more your points multiplier increases. You can use the points to buy exotic motors like the high-performance Porsche 911 GT. There are 26 fully customizable cars available to buy in total. \n\nDrift Hunters has a smooth arcade-racer feel but isn’t constrained to a racing format. Instead, you can blaze your own trail in several locations, racking up points to buy new cars and upgrades. The graphics are great for the web, but you can play the game on low-spec devices without a hiccup. It’s a must-play for drift enthusiasts!\n\nTips\nUse acceleration cautiously when approaching corners mid-drift\nDrift from side to side on straight roads to keep the drift alive\nTune up your vehicles to find the sweet spot for maximum drift\nDrive on maps with plenty of space for long, uninterrupted drifting\nMore Games Like This\n\nDriving games are super addictive when they're as good as Drift Hunters.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun.

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

Embark on an epic journey through this magical world, brimming with perilous encounters and thrilling adventures at every turn. Traverse through the looking glass into a realm of enigmatic puzzles and terrifying foes. Unravel the mysteries, aid mythical beings, vanquish villains, and safeguard the universe of Mirrorland. With stunning visuals, an immersive storyline, diverse hero selection, and engaging multiplayer features, prepare for an unforgettable quest where bravery and cunning are your greatest weapons.\n\nHow to Play Mirrorland\n\nFirst things first. To play Mirrorland, you will need to create an online account and select your character (and sidekick). The adventure begins as you ride on horseback along a mysterious, winding path. Your first challenge awaits when the Cheshire Cat, a mischievous yet endearing creature, falls into a hole. Demonstrate your courage and compassion by rescuing him, and in return, he will pledge his unwavering loyalty, becoming your trusted companion and guide throughout the game (sidekick!).\n\nAs you ride further into Mirrorland, the landscape comes alive with the promise of riches. Treasure chests brimming with rewards, glittering gold, and radiant crystals are scattered across your path, waiting to be claimed. Cheshire often spots these hidden troves, so listen to him so you won't miss an opportunity to increase your bounty.\n\nThe road is far from quiet—and cries for help are common. You will need to respond to these pleas to form allies. Battle goblins to protect defenseless victims, shield the White Rabbit as he flees from ominous pursuers, and deliver urgent messages to reunite estranged brothers. Each act of bravery and kindness enriches your story, offering rewards that strengthen your resolve and resources.\n\nThe gameplay is a captivating mix of strategy and direction. Carefully follow the prompts to guide your decisions and immerse yourself in the unfolding narrative. When combat arises, engage in intuitive battles by dragging and dropping attacks to strike down foes. Victory requires precision and skill as you navigate these skirmishes. Beyond the thrill of battle, gather gold, hoard crystals, and complete quests to uncover the deeper layers of Mirrorland’s magic. With every step, your character evolves, and the enchanting world around you reveals its secrets.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe adventure doesn’t have to stop here. Continue playing adventure games.

Create your team from over 50 unique heroes, each inspired by iconic characters you know and love. Dive into intense real-time PvP battles where your skills and tactics are put to the ultimate test. Join forces with fellow guild players to take on epic quests across breathtaking locations, from ancient ruins to mystical landscapes. As you progress, you can upgrade your heroes and gear, enhancing their abilities and unlocking new powers.\n\nHow to Play Battle Arena\n\nIn a world overrun by demons, you must choose a region at a time to combat your opponent. Battle Arena fights start off in Serenity Valley, where you can assess your enemy's squad in just a tap. You get to select your heroes for battle. You begin with only three heroes to play with, each with a different weapon and skill. But the amount of heroes you can eventually upgrade to is countless.\n\nEarly in the game, you will fight Dark Lord, who is less than happy to see you. To win the initial battle and every one afterward, you must use your hero's unique skills—some wield swords while others shoot arrows. Just tap on their avatars at the bottom of the screen to strengthen your attacks.\n\nIn Battle Arena, your objective is pretty much to build and upgrade your heroes and compete in various challenges, particularly in the arena. The gameplay revolves around gathering resources and gaining experience points to level up. Players can participate in raids to acquire new heroes and enhance their existing ones. The key to success in this game is to strategize by selecting the right battle heroes to maximize team effectiveness.\n\nAs you engage in battles, you must use different abilities and relics, which provide unique advantages during combat. Upgrading heroes is crucial to improve your performance in battles.\n\nAlways pay attention to your heroes' health and manage resources wisely, especially during expeditions and arena fights. Using a mix of heroes with complementary skills can lead to successful team combinations and help defeat stronger opponents.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to push through the ranks in the arena by strategizing hero placements and leveraging their abilities effectively. You can earn significant rewards as you progress, which can be reinvested into your hero roster.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore a wide array of adventure games at your fingertips!

Cultivate crops, expand your business, and manage a skilled team. Explore untamed areas, unravel intriguing mysteries, and connect with the charming residents of Woodburn as you build your agricultural empire from the ground up.\n\nHow to Play Country Life Meadows\n\nWelcome to your new farm! You’ve just acquired Roadside Farm, or whatever name you choose, and it’s time to embrace farm life. But first, here’s a letter from the previous owner that will give you an idea of your situation:\n\nHi,\n\nCongrats on buying my farm! Sorry to hear you got stranded overnight - wish I could’ve helped fix your car. I don’t remember that rock being on the road… strange. Anyway, I asked around for help, and hopefully, you’ll find an oil pan soon.\n\nYou were right about the sunrises - they're stunning, much better than in the city! The soil here is top-notch too. Too bad I had to leave in such a rush. Life happens...\n\nThis land is the best spot on that flat hilltop, right near the road. It’s called Roadside Farm, but feel free to rename it. Oh, and please take care of Clarabella!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJim Grey\n\nNow that you’re settling in, it’s time to start farming. Each day brings new rewards, so be sure to check in and claim them. The key to a thriving farm is planting, harvesting, and managing your resources wisely. Sow your seeds, take care of your animals, and keep an eye on your barn and warehouse to track what you’ve gathered. As you grow your farm, you’ll have the chance to expand your land, unlocking even more opportunities to cultivate crops and raise livestock.\n\nClover is an essential crop for your animals. Cows, turkeys, and goats love it, and if you have bees, they’ll pollinate it, producing honey before harvest. Clover is also used in the production of milk, black feathers, and white feathers. Wheat is another staple: grind it at the Dutch Mill to make flour or use it to feed your sheep. It’s a key ingredient in making flour, vodka, wool, and black wool. If you need milk, make sure to feed your Holstein cows. A full cow is a happy cow, and happy cows keep your farm running smoothly.\n\nYour farm has several important buildings to manage. The Dutch Mill turns wheat into flour, and keeping it filled will power the windmill. The barn stores essentials like wheat, clover, and flour, while the warehouse holds resources such as honey, sugar, oxygen, and propane. As you progress, you’ll gain access to even more supplies, including gear, decorations, chests, and medals. Keep an eye on your stockpile to prepare for the next task.\n\nWhile ripe crops are beautiful to look at, don’t forget to harvest and replant to keep your farm productive. Wheat should always be replenished, and replanting clover on eight plots of soil will ensure a steady supply. Adding sacks of wheat to the Dutch Mill will keep your flour production running smoothly. The more you maintain your farm, the more opportunities you’ll unlock, allowing you to expand even further. Check the map to see just how vast your farm can become.\n\nBeyond the daily farm routine, there are plenty of ways to engage with the world around you. If you enjoy a relaxed farming experience, you’ll love the peaceful rhythm of planting and harvesting, accompanied by soothing animations and calming sounds. For those who like a challenge, competitions, achievements, horse racing, and leaderboards offer ways to test your skills and earn permanent prizes. The farming co-op lets you collaborate with fellow players, whether by sending Wedding Doves to ceremonies or trading produce at the Market.\n\nNeighbors are a valuable part of farm life. The more neighbors you have, the more gifts you’ll receive, helping you progress faster. You can also personalize your farm with beautiful artwork and decorations, customizing both your Farmhouse and Log Cabin. If you feel like exploring, venture into the surrounding landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots, or head to the mines to uncover valuable ores and hidden riches.\n\nWith so much to do, you can play Country Life Meadows your way. Relax and unwind with hours of farming fun, compete to showcase your skills, or grow your farm into a flourishing empire. The possibilities are endless: so start planting and watch your farm come to life!\n\nFeatures\nPlay to Relax: Unwind with hundreds of hours of farming fun. Revel in the soothing daily routine of planting and harvesting your crops, complete with beautiful animations and calming sounds.\nPlay to Compete: Test your skills in Competitions, Achievements, Horse Racing, and Leaderboards. Earn permanent prizes, and rewards, and showcase your public stats.\nFarming Co-op: Collaborate with fellow players to achieve common goals. From sending Wedding Doves to weddings to participating in the all-new Market where you can exchange produce with others, teamwork is key.\nNeighborly Gifts: Your Neighbors can send you valuable gifts, so the more neighbors, the faster you’ll progress.\nArtwork: We focus on crafting beautiful in-game artwork rather than promotional materials, so what you see is what you get.\nInterior Decoration: Personalize the interior of your Farmhouse and your Log Cabin in the woods.\nExploration: Venture into vast, picturesque landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots.\nMining: Delve into the depths of The Mines to discover ores and riches.\nBarn Management: Our Barn management offers unparalleled control with filtering options that help you maximize your results.\nMore Games Like This\n\nFinished playing and looking for more?

Build magnificent cities, develop resources, and create a unique culture while engaging in trade and diplomacy. Expand your influence, make historic discoveries, and craft wonders that will be remembered for centuries. Your choices shape the future of your empire: lead wisely!\n\nHow to Play Empire City\n\nEmpire City is a classic management game set in ancient times where you get to build an entire city, including roadways, residential homes, waterways, workshops, and more -- all from a blank slate with a bit of help from two close advisors: Julia and Flavius.\n\nThe game starts with a full intro from Julia and Flavius, which will walk you through step by step how to build your city. Once you have the hang of it, you're on your own. But not to worry, help from your advisors is just a click away.\n\nJulia and Flavius guide you through the following directions:\n\nJulia: \"Welcome to the city, Prefect! I’m Julia. I run an inn here, and I know everything about everyone. This is Flavius, the architect.\"\n\nFlavius: \"My projects can do the talking for me! The first one is a residential building. Let’s get to work!\"\n\nJulia: \"Remember, every building in the city must be connected to a road.\"\n\nAction: You get to build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"Congratulations, Prefect! The building is ready. We can house people in it now.\"\n\nJulia: \"People?! There’s barely room for one citizen. The building needs to be upgraded.\"\n\nAction: Build a house.\n\nFlavius: \"Prefect, we have a problem. We need clay to make the house more spacious, but it’s mined outside the city.\"\n\nJulia: \"If it’s even mined at all! The clay quarry is in bad shape, and the tool storage is totally dilapidated. But our Prefect can solve that, right?\"\n\nAction: Fix the clay quarry.\n\nJulia: \"Now we can hire a manager! But that can happen later. First, we need to build a road to deliver the clay to the city.\"\n\nAction: Build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"The road is wonderful, Prefect! Collect the mined clay, and my people will deliver it to the construction site right away.\"\n\nAction: Collect the clay.\n\nFlavius: \"Thank you for the help. I’ll get to work upgrading the house right now!\"\n\nJulia: \"You and Flavius are doing wonderfully! Let’s upgrade another house. It could use a second floor, with a good view of the city.\"\n\nFlavius: \"Regular clay isn’t enough to build another floor. This requires a sturdier material, such as clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Alas, this material isn’t produced in our city. Although the Prefect could give orders to build a special workshop.\"\n\nJulia: \"If you don’t want to wait, use gems! Their shine speeds up any project. The first time is free, though.\"\n\nAction: Use gems.\n\nFlavius: \"Very grand, Prefect. Now we won’t lack building materials. Give the order to produce clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Production can take a long time. When it ends, a clay mixture icon will appear above the workshop.\"\n\nAction: Wait for production to finish.\n\nFlavius: \"It’s ready, Prefect! Tap the icon to move the mixture to the warehouse.\"\n\nAction: Move the mixture to the warehouse.\n\nJulia: \"So, are we going to upgrade the house or just pretend that it’s intentionally unfinished?\"\n\nFlavius: \"Please accept this scroll. I sketched out some improvements. Remember, Prefect, Julia and I are always here to support you!\"\n\nYou're on your own after this training. Continue building your empire and make Julia and Flavius proud, Prefect!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are in Empire City, you may like more games within our casual game category, so go ahead and have a look!

Your main task is strategically dominating the battlefield to constantly upgrade your army and conquer enemies in an epic 1v1 battle. Lead your army to victory in this strategic game and show your earned skills to the modern world.\n\nThe old Flash game from 2007, Age of War, by Max Game Studios, has clearly been a source of inspiration for Age of Tanks Warriors.\n\nHow to Play Age of Tanks Warriors: TD War\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors is a one-click battle game, so the actual combat portion of the game is fairly simple. The difficulty lies in devising a strategy for utilizing your army and weapons to eliminate your opponents before they can eliminate you and destroy your fortress. Once you do this, you get to upgrade your army and weapons for an even more effective strategy.\n\nThe game begins with your stone cave, which is directly opposite your opponent's cave. You can deploy your soldiers by clicking the small icon on the bottom right of your screen. The only hitch is that you may not have enough soldiers to send out in time to match your opponent's troops!\n\nYour task on each level is to defeat the opposing army and destroy their shelter. As the levels advance, so do the fortresses, making it even more difficult throughout the ages. Fighting begins with sticks and stones, but eventually turns into tanks and artillery.\n\nTips\n\nCollect as many coins and as much food as possible by watching some of the ads. This will help strengthen your troop. Otherwise, it's a bit difficult, as the opponent starts with an advantage.\n\nDon't deploy too many troops straight away. It's best to deploy when the enemy is closer to home territory.\n\nYou can defeat multiple enemies with one of your soldiers, so be skillful in how many you send out simultaneously and which ones.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of battle games, browse our vast selection of popular titles.\n\nAdditional titles that require strategic thinking include Bubble Shooter and 2048.\n\nRelease Date\nFebruary 2024 (Android)\nApril 2024 (iOS)\nApril 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\nLast Updated\n\nJun 10, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact with the game UI.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the age of war military game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War game is an action tower defense battle game in which you fight your opponent to death throughout the ages.\n\nIs Age of Tanks Warriors a good game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War is one of the more popular action titles.

With danger around every corner, your aim is to keep calm and survive the end of the zombie apocalypse.\n\nHow to Play Dead Land: Survival\n\nSet out on a treacherous quest through the desolate lands of Dead Land: Survival, where the world has fallen to ruin, and the infected ones lurk around every corner.

With the help of your assistant, Agatha, and a cast of brilliant engineers like the self-taught Ida, you’ll bring your creative vision of progress to life while balancing the city’s needs and resources.\n\nHow to Play Steam City\n\nYour journey begins with a warm welcome from Agatha, who will guide you through the essentials of city planning. Start by meeting key figures like Ida, a resourceful engineer who quickly points out that the builders already need your support. As mayor, you will complete the exciting task of building the city’s housing. Head to the construction workshop, select your first house and drag it onto the map. Every building requires a road for access, so plan strategically. From modest homes to grand residences, you will be able to design spacious, comfortable houses that cater to a growing population.\n\nResources are the lifeblood of your city’s development. Start by extracting natural resources like sand to produce essential building materials in your factories. When the sand runs out, you must activate the nearby quarries with a steam excavator to keep construction moving. You’ll face key decisions about which resources to sell on the market or export to neighboring cities to maximize your city’s income and growth.\n\nTo ensure your city thrives, you’ll manage a journal of tasks that will help you address urgent issues and develop strategic improvements. Completing tasks not only rewards you but also elevates your status as mayor, unlocking new opportunities and growth for your city.\n\nAs your city grows, connecting with fellow mayors becomes essential. Create a union and invite others to join, fostering a community where you can exchange resources, tackle challenges together, and discuss city issues openly. This collaboration can help you overcome obstacles and bring prosperity to all members.\n\nA bustling city is a profitable one. Collect taxes from commercial buildings to expand your city’s territory, build new infrastructure, and grow your population. As your reputation and resources grow, you’ll have the opportunity to construct more advanced buildings, meet the rising demands of your citizens, and create a city that’s uniquely yours in Steam City.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more fun, casual games to choose from.

Hire top-tier trainers, equip your gyms with cutting-edge gear, and plan strategic fight plans. Scout talented fighters, recruit rising stars and guide them to championship glory. Every decision shapes your path to becoming the ultimate MMA manager.\n\nHow to Play MMA Manager 2\n\nTo become a champion in MMA Manager 2, you’ll need to start small, build your skills, and work your way up to owning a top-tier gym. Begin by recruiting your first fighter through the roster, where you can either hire a premade fighter or create your own from scratch. When making a fighter, you’ll first choose a weight class and skin type: these don’t affect performance. Then, customize your fighter’s identity with their name, hometown, and country of origin. Next, select a fight-style background, which determines their initial skill set.\n\nFighting Styles and Primary Skills:\n\nWrestling: Punches, takedowns, ground grappling. Wrestlers dominate ground positions, delivering powerful blows while keeping opponents pinned.\n\nTaekwondo: High kicks. A risky style relies on complex, high-impact kicks that can be devastating when executed effectively.\n\nMuay Thai (Elbows): Elbows, clinch work. Close-combat specialists use clinches and swift elbow combos to wear opponents down.\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ): Takedowns, ground grappling, submissions. BJJ fighters control ground situations and force opponents to submit with painful holds.\n\nKickboxing: Punches, low kicks. A striking style blending fast punches and relentless low kicks to overwhelm opponents.\n\nMuay Thai (Knees): Knees, clinch work. Knee-focused Muay Thai fighters deal significant damage with precision strikes during close combat.\n\nAfter recruiting, your fighters will begin competing in matches, but their actual growth happens in the gym. Train them to enhance their strengths or develop new skills. Training uses stamina, which gradually replenishes over time but cannot exceed a fighter’s maximum capacity. Check stamina levels in the gym view using the stamina ring, and ensure you’re training fighters as soon as they’re ready.\n\nEach match becomes progressively more complex, requiring strategic planning and practical training. Winning fights brings you closer to becoming a professional and achieving your dream of owning the best gym in the business!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore some of our most exciting sports titles, starting with Basketbros, a fast-paced basketball game offering both online and offline gameplay.

This game is ideal for card players, especially solitaire fans, as it is intuitive to pick up quickly with similar solitaire gameplay but with a slight twist—cards are not in laid out the same way, suits don't matter and rank order can go from high to low to high again!\n\nHow to Play Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks\n\nThe aim of the game is to match cards by rank. Tap a card that is either one rank higher or lower than the card you are working from. For example, if you have a 5, you can play a 6 or a 4. This sequence can continue in either direction (e.g., 4 → 5 → 6 or 6 → 5 → 4).\n\nThe Table Setup\n\nThe game begins with a dynamic layout of cards on the table, blending uncovered cards. You can play with covered cards waiting to be revealed. Your objective is to build sequences using only the uncovered cards, so strategize carefully to unlock new possibilities.\n\nAt the bottom of the game board, you’ll find your home base card, the foundation of your sequences. Every move you make starts here, guiding your progress through the game. Next to your home base is the deck of cards, your lifeline when you run out of moves on the table. Draw from this deck to refresh your strategy and keep the game moving forward.\n\nPay close attention to how the cards are arranged, and start planning your moves to reveal hidden opportunities and outsmart the deck!\n\nSuits don’t matter, so you can match cards regardless of their suit, focusing solely on their numerical value.\n\nThe key to winning is to strategize your moves. It’s often best to start with a lower-numbered card so you have more flexibility to build sequences. Aim to clear as many cards as possible with each move by carefully planning increases and decreases (e.g., a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 removes multiple cards).\n\nIf no moves are available, you will be prompted to draw a card from the deck. The card you draw becomes the new card you must build from. If no uncovered cards are playable, you’ll also need to draw from the deck.\n\nThe game becomes more challenging as you go. Occasionally, you may receive prompts to add five more cards to the table, increasing the difficulty. If you make a move you regret, use the Undo button to revise your strategy.\n\nKings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks Tip\n\nIf you have several sequence options, prioritize moves that remove the most cards from the table or deck. For example, a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 can clear more cards than a straight increase like 4 → 5 → 6.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more casual game fun? We've got you covered! There are plenty of games worth a try, which include Backgammon Online, a timeless board game brought online with all the original rules; Bubble Shooter, a match-3 colored pop bubble game; or Tile Guru, a tile-matching game that combines mental sharpness with relaxation.\n\nRelease Date\nJuly 2020 (Android)\nSeptember 2020 (HTML5).\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 09, 2024\n\nControls\nUse the left mouse button to choose cards.\nFAQ\nHow to play Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?\n\nKings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks combines solitaire gameplay but with some twists—you need to rank cards in descending or ascending order, and suits don't count!\n\nDo you have to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?\n\nYou do not need to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks.\n\nGameplay Video",

Spend just 10 minutes a day matching vibrant 3D tiles and finding new fruit designs while mastering strategic match flips. With its unique puzzlescapes, escalating challenges, and a serene zen-inspired color palette, this game offers a perfect blend of brain training and tranquility, making it your ideal daily escape.\n\nHow to Play Tile Guru\n\nTile Guru is one of those addictive games that you find yourself playing for hours, day after day. The aim of the game is fairly simple - you need to match sets of three tiles of the same suit.\n\nYou'll start with a colorful array of fruit-themed tiles—grapes, watermelon, apples, cherries, and more. Click on each tile, and it will fall into the tile holder section. Once you get three matching tiles in the tile holder, they will disappear to make room for more. Early levels keep things simple, as all tiles are the same, making it easy to match a set of three. As the levels continue, the challenges get harder.\n\nYour tile holder is where the magic happens, and it is the part that requires the most strategy. The tile holder holds up to 7 tiles—if the holder fills up with unmatched tiles, the game is over!

They are difficult, but not impossible. Your goal is to reach the finish line, whether you can get through dangerous obstacles or not-so-dangerous ones. Any collision will likely destroy your car. Precision is key to survival, making this game ideal for anyone seeking a thrill.\n\nHow to Play Deadly Descent\n\nPrepare for the most intense, destructive races of your life in Deadly Descent.\n\nYou will be on a dirt road track or similar landscapes with nothing but speed in your control.\n\nMost of the races will leave your car completely destroyed, smashed, flipped, torn apart, catapulted off the edge, or worse. But the key is to get there first. Yes, it may sound odd, but your goal is to be the fastest in the race and survive as best you can with a banged-up car rather than suffer a fatal off-road accident.\n\nKeep your speed steady. Going fast will help you reach the finish line quickly, but it can also generate the force to destroy your car if you lose control.\n\nGive yourself enough time to brake and navigate obstacles such as smashing levers, spiked rolling crushers, sporadic crates, and more. If your car flips, you can survive if it gets banged up, no problem. But if it hits any of these objects at full force, you are likely not going to make it out of the round in one piece.\n\nEach round offers new obstacles to overcome, challenging your reflexes and strategy as you push your car to the limit.\n\nFeatures\nDestructible vehicles\nRefined physics and detailed graphics\nUnique tracks and endless challenges\nThe experience is highly realistic while remaining optimized to run smoothly on both phones and computers.\nMore Games Like This\n\nSatiate your need for speed with a few more driving games from our vast selection.

Start your career as a professional racer and climb the ranks through thrilling campaign races, upgrading your car to enhance performance along the way. With simple controls that let you navigate sharp corners effortlessly, stunning 3D graphics, realistic engine sounds, and customizable camera views, the game offers an immersive and adrenaline-packed experience.\n\nHow to Play Super Star Car\n\nSuper Star Car is all about speed, precision, and strategy as you race through an exciting career mode. Every time you finish a race in this mode, you’ll earn stars and money, helping you climb the leaderboard and unlock new opportunities. Use your winnings to upgrade your car strategically, boosting its performance and ensuring that every race feels fresh and thrilling.\n\nThe game features several tracks, each with its own unique challenges. You can select from iconic maps such as Arcport Circuit, Yafield Park, Riverside Circuit, and many more. Each track will test your skills, particularly when it comes to navigating those sharp curves. As expected, corners are the most challenging part of the game: you’ll need to hold your steering steady to maintain control. If you find yourself off the track, simply press the space bar to reset and get back into the action.\n\nTo aid your racing strategy, there’s a mini-map in the bottom-left corner of your screen, giving you a sneak peek at upcoming turns and obstacles so you can prepare ahead. Keep an eye on your speedometer, located at the bottom-right corner, to adjust your pace and avoid spinning out on tight bends.\n\nOne of the standout features of Super Star Car is its multiple view modes. You can race from a bird' s-eye view, chase your car from behind, or fully immerse yourself in the action by switching to the driver’s seat view. This versatility lets you experience the game from different perspectives, adding to its excitement and variety.\n\nThe heart of the game lies in its career mode, where every win brings you closer to the coveted championship trophy. It’s not just about crossing the finish line first; it’s also about improving your car with carefully chosen upgrades. A better-performing car will help you dominate tougher races as you progress through the campaign.\n\nGet ready to tackle adrenaline-pumping tracks and outmaneuver your rivals.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you love the thrill of F1 driving, head over to our driving games where you’ll find top titles like Moto X3M, a game that mixes high-speed adventures with a test of precision across 22 levels; PolyTrack, high-speed, low-poly racing game packed with loops, jumps, and adrenaline-fueled action or Mr Racer, a thrilling racing game where you zoom through busy streets across various locations.\n\nFeatures\nFully featured career mode\nSeveral tracks to race on\nProfile with detailed stats\nIn-car and 3rd-person views\nDetailed 3D graphics\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2021\n\nDeveloper\n\nSuper Star Car is developed by Barnzmu.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 19, 2025\n\nControls\nW or up arrow to accelerate\nAD or left and right arrow keys to steer\nC to change camera view\nSpacebar to respawn position\n\nXbox Controller supported\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Super Star Car on my phone?\n\nUnfortunately, Super Star Car is currently available to play only on desktop.\n\nIs Super Star Car free to play?\n\nSuper Star Car is free to play on desktop and can be found on CrazyGames.\n\nHow to play Super Star Car?\nW or up arrow to accelerate\nAD or left and right arrow keys to steer\nC to change camera view\nSpacebar to respawn position\nCan I use my Xbox controller to play Super Star Car?\n\nYes, Super Star Car is Xbox Controller supported.\n\nWhat is the no. 1 racing game?\n\nThere are too many racing games to choose from.

Get ready to leave your mark on the asphalt, literally!\n\nHow to Play Drift Hunters\n\nYou start Drift Hunters by selecting your car and the type of ride you want to take. You can upgrade the performance, including the brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine, with superior parts. You can also finish off your car in any color and enjoy a selection of rims on the house.\n\nThe key to this game is scoring points by drifting your car. The more you drift, the more points you get, which you can then spend in the garage to fine-tune your car.\n\nRace Tracks: Drift through diverse circuits like Nishuri, Stadium, Tyshen, and more. Each track offers a unique layout with varied curves and turns, challenging your drifting skills to the max.\n\nCars: Rack up at least 8,500 points to start unlocking cars, with the top model costing over 134k points. Every drift and upgrade gets you closer to that dream ride! If you are a beginner, you might find that it is better to focus on optimizing the performance of entry-level cars before investing all your cash on a new ride.\n\nDrift Hunters available cars:\n\nBMW M3\nToyota Supra\nHonda S2000\nFord Fiesta ST\nNissan 370Z coupe\nDodge Challenger Hellcat\nNissan GTR\nPorsche 911 GT\nAnd 18 more cars...\n\nParts & Upgrades: Customize your vehicle’s performance with upgrades to brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine.\n\nTuning: Adjust your car’s fine-tuning settings, including front and rear camber, offset, brake balance, height, and brake pressure, to perfect your drift style even without additional upgrades.\n\nVisuals: Express your style by customizing the color of your car’s body and rims, and select from a range of rim designs to complete your look.\n\nEvery car you buy can be fully tuned: turbo, brakes, engine, gearbox and weight can range from \"street\" level, the lowest, to the \"pro\", which is also the most expensive. You can fully modify these values to find the best tuning for your drift performance.\n\nSome tracks allow you to keep drifting much more easily than others. The best tracks for drifting in Drift Hunters are Emashi and Forest because of their long corners and lack of too many sharp turns. The Forest track features the longest corners, allowing for the most prolonged drifts.\n\nThe longer you drift, the more your points multiplier increases. You can use the points to buy exotic motors like the high-performance Porsche 911 GT. There are 26 fully customizable cars available to buy in total. \n\nDrift Hunters has a smooth arcade-racer feel but isn’t constrained to a racing format. Instead, you can blaze your own trail in several locations, racking up points to buy new cars and upgrades. The graphics are great for the web, but you can play the game on low-spec devices without a hiccup. It’s a must-play for drift enthusiasts!\n\nTips\nUse acceleration cautiously when approaching corners mid-drift\nDrift from side to side on straight roads to keep the drift alive\nTune up your vehicles to find the sweet spot for maximum drift\nDrive on maps with plenty of space for long, uninterrupted drifting\nMore Games Like This\n\nDriving games are super addictive when they're as good as Drift Hunters.

You race a car you've customized, on a track you might have designed yourself. This is a fast-paced, low-poly driving game featuring thrilling loops, jumps, and high-speed action where every millisecond counts.\n\nInspired by TrackMania, it challenges you to race against the clock, constantly striving to improve your time on various tracks built by you and the Polytrack community! It doesn't get any more hands-on than that.\n\nHow to Play Polytrack\n\nYou can race on the racecourses you've designed, but it's probably easier to start with the existing ones. You not only have to think about beating your own record when it comes to time, but you also need to master the craft of building for speed and precision.\n\nStart by creating your track using the game’s design tools or choosing from pre-made tracks. Customize the track with various obstacles, ramps, and curves to suit your preferences. Don't know exactly what track to build? Get help from the Polytrack community. There are plenty of forums that share design codes and customization tips.\n\nWith a built-in level editor, you can unleash your creativity by designing custom tracks. You can also export and share these tracks with others for endless racing (and design) fun.\n\nThe game will require time and patience, as you don't just go into it like other driving games, with your foot on the pedal and ready to rev and drift. Initially, the easiest tracks to build are straight lines, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you will have a track jumping over mountains, sending your car and score soaring.\n\nYou can also customize your vehicle by choosing a primary and secondary color, as well as the color of the car frame and rims.\n\nA series of premade tracks is available for those who want to begin practicing and getting a feel for other designs.\n\nPolyTrack Unique Features\n\nWhen selecting a track, you can see the best lap times recorded by verified players on it and measure yourself against them.\n\nOne cool feature that differentiates PolyTrack from other driving games is the opportunity to challenge opponents asynchronously, by selecting them from the leaderboard before starting the game, and seeing them as “ghosts” as you race the track. You can also challenge yourself by shaving off some decimals from your best time and then have your car “ghosted” on the track.\n\nAvailable Tracks\n\nThere are currently 15 Official tracks and 22 Community-made tracks:\n\nOfficial tracks:\n\n7 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n4 desert tracks\n\nCommunity tracks:\n\n9 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n9 desert tracks\n\nThe driving experience remains unaltered, independent of the track season: what changes is the scenery surrounding the track.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce you've mastered building your tracks, you can enjoy these other thrilling driving games: Moto X3M, where you experience high-octane motocross action with challenging courses, stunts, and exciting levels, or Drift Hunters, where you test your drifting skills in this game that features a variety of cars and tracks designed for perfecting those thrilling drifts.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 2023\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 17, 2025\n\nControls\nDriving Controls\nWASD / arrow keys = drive\nEnter / R = restart\nEditor Controls\nLeft-click = build\nRight-click + move = move camera view\nMiddle mouse-click + move = rotate camera view\nMouse-scroll = zoom in / out\nShift + mouse-scroll / ZC = height up / down\nQE = rotate camera view to the left / right\nR / Space = rotate item\nX = delete item\nT = test drive\nFAQ\nHow to play Polytrack?\n\nIn Polytrack, you race a car you customize on a track you've designed yourself.

In Moscow Metro Driver 3D, you’re responsible for getting passengers safely through the underground tunnels of the Russian capital. Don’t worry, you’ll get a full tutorial and training.\n\nYou have quite a sophisticated dashboard to work with, with features like switching camera views to see the train in motion from the side, peeking inside the passenger cars, or looking straight ahead through the windshield. Feel free to explore each perspective as you make your run.\n\nBefore departing a station, use the door switch to open and close the doors. When the doors open, grab the megaphone and make an announcement to your passengers. After all, communication is key on a busy metro line.\n\nUse the X scale to get the train moving. Keep an eye on your speed and don’t go above the limit, but don’t crawl along either, or you’ll never make it to the next stop on time.\n\nWhen it’s time to stop, approach the platform carefully. The front of your train should be no more than 3 meters from the rail. Miss your mark, and you’ll find yourself with half the train in the tunnel and half out, not exactly a great look for a new driver.\n\nSpeed controls:\n\nX1 – X4 are your forward speeds, with X4 being the fastest.\n0 is neutral.\nT1 – T3 control your braking, with T3 bringing you to a complete stop.\n\nOnce you’ve reached your desired speed, set it to 0 to maintain your pace.\n\nYour current speed limit appears in red, while the following one shows in yellow. Keep an eye on both so you can start slowing down in time. You’ll also see how many meters remain in your route, giving you an idea of how much longer you’ll be driving.\n\nIf you stop too far from the platform railing, passengers won’t be able to board, and you won’t get the door signal. If that happens, ease the train forward a little until everything lines up.\n\nAnd if you miss your stop altogether? Just keep going to the next station and be sure to make an announcement to your passengers.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore our driving games to stay behind the wheel.

Navigate through thrilling levels, jumping over gaps and dodging obstacles. Get ready for an adrenaline rush as you tackle exciting challenges on your way to victory!\n\nHow to Play Crazy Motorcycle\n\nCrazy Motorcycle combines Minecraft graphics with classic 80s arcade gameplay. Your movements are limited to left, right, up, down, and jumping. Simple but all crucial to your survival on this obstacle-ridden bike course. You also have control over the sound being on or off. Ah, the good old days were when choice was more tangible. The lack of frills is no measure of fun in this thrilling bike race in the sky.\n\nThere are four available worlds to play in, with different terrains and obstacles in each of them. In every world, there are 16 stages to complete before getting to the end.\n\nThe object of the game is to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards to fatten your final score. You will mainly be going straight with the occasional moves to the right and left to avoid hitting obstacles or, worse, meeting your fate with the abyss below you by falling off the race track.\n\nYou can't get away with a straight run, and even on level one, you must maneuver to avoid falling to your demise.\n\nThe race course is also not entirely linear, and there are breaks in the course with nothing below you but chance. This is where your jumps will come into play. The wider the gap, the more speed and jump you will need to cross the divide.\n\nIf you see a series of swerving roads ahead with moving obstacles, slow down to retain your balance and avoid getting knocked off the road. The key to moving items is to move with them, even if you get close to the edge. Not all items can be jumped over.\n\nGrab the red flags along the road; they represent checkpoints and allow you to restart from there should you fall, while yellow flags let you collect coins, which you can use to buy new voxelated skins in the menu.\n\nLastly, you can compete against other players by checking your score against theirs in the leaderboard, also available in the main menu.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBuckle up or wear your helmet and check out more of our driving games! Moto X3M takes you on a wild ride with daring motorcycle stunts and challenging tracks.\n\nAn additional option to drive a car is represented by Eggy Car, while if you are looking for a totally different alternative, you can try Little Alchemy.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJune 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 14, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD or arrow keys to move\nSpace to jump\nLeft mouse button to interact with in-game UI\nFAQ\nWhat is the motorcycle arcade game called?\n\nPlenty of motorcycle games are available to play online - a few popular ones include Moto X3M and Crazy Motorcycle.\n\nHow do you avoid falling off the edge in Crazy Motorcycle game?\n\nMake subtle moves.

Some of these high-octane vehicles can also be unlocked simply by watching ads.\n\nMountain mode\n\nIn the rugged mountain mode, take on everyday tasks such as picking up workers from factories and guiding tourists through breathtaking landscapes, like a scenic water dam nestled among the hills. The winding roads and picturesque vistas will challenge your driving skills, making every trip an unforgettable adventure. Be careful not to get stuck because if you do, you'll have to start over.\n\nCity mode\n\nMeanwhile, city mode thrusts you into the hustle and bustle of urban life. Navigate narrow streets, pick up commuters, and drop them off at their destinations, whether it’s a restaurant for breakfast or the office for a busy day ahead. You’ll have to master city traffic, pedestrians, and tight turns while keeping your passengers safe and satisfied.\n\nWith pretty realistic graphics, sounds, and dynamic gameplay, the Bus Driving Simulator brings the thrill of real-world bus driving to your mousepad. Conquer treacherous terrain, race through busy streets, and take on heart-pounding missions in a variety of weather conditions.

It combines high-speed thrills with a test of precision and timing across 22 adrenaline-filled levels. Each course introduces fresh, intense obstacles from gravity-defying loops to dangerous ramps and explosive traps that keep you on the edge of your seat. Gear up, strap on your helmet, and prepare to perform stunts of a lifetime as you race against the clock.\n\nHow to Play Moto X3M\n\nSit back, hold on tight, and get ready for a thrilling bike ride (with pretty exciting music). Each level of Moto X3M ramps up the thrill with increasingly complex obstacles that require precision, skill, and, above all, patience. Don't get too distracted by the fun; every mistake comes at a price, and that price is time. And time is the key to nailing the coveted 3-star rating, where only the fastest, cleanest runs bring you victory.\n\nMastering each level means finding that sweet spot between speed, braking, and stunt work, all while dodging obstacles designed to slow you down.\n\nMoto X3M offers 22 distinct tracks, each progressively challenging. While the early levels ease you, later tracks become obstacle-filled gauntlets of ramps, loops, and hazards. With each track’s unique layout, there’s plenty of replay value as you strive to beat your best time. The game can get pretty addictive.\n\nAs you conquer each course, you will earn stars and can use them to unlock two new bikes! It’s more than just a visual upgrade; new bikes give you added motivation to return to tracks and push for faster times and higher scores.\n\nMoto X3M features vibrant 2D graphics, fluid physics-based animation, and a playful, slapstick tone. Crashes are humorous, with ragdoll physics and cartoon-style explosions keeping the action lighthearted. Each track has its own theme, from sunny beaches to underground caves, while energetic music and sound effects heighten the thrill of racing and performing stunts.\n\nPush your speed to the max, but don't rush into unknown obstacles without caution. Every fall adds seconds, impacting your star rating. Aim to squeeze in as many air stunts as you can over big jumps to shave precious seconds off your final time!\n\nAdvanced Moves\nFlips & Combos: Chain flips on long jumps to reduce your final time.\nBack Wheel Boost: Landing on your rear wheel at the right angle gives a speed boost.\nTimer Delay Trick: Wait for the perfect moment to start moving and effectively pause the timer.\nHidden Shortcuts: Some levels allow creative routes to bypass obstacles or save time.\nGame Levels\n\nLevels unlock sequentially, growing in difficulty from beginner-friendly ramps to extreme obstacles. Stars earned on each level unlock new bikes, adding visual variety and motivation to replay tracks. Checkpoints prevent frustration, letting you retry tricky sections without restarting the entire level.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nKeep your wheels on the ground for maximum speed when needed, but don’t hesitate to brake approaching tricky obstacles.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many games in the Moto X3M series, like Basketball Legends and Basketball Stars. You can also browse our driving category and try popular titles where you drive fast in Snow Rider 3D. How fast can you go on ice?

Obstacles lurk at every turn, and if you’re not careful, slowing down could send you spiraling into an abyss.\n\nMega Ramps is the ultimate test of your driving skills, packed with high-speed thrills and perilous obstacles.

If you get thrown off, you’ll face a brutal penalty: no car collisions for a full five minutes! In another high-stakes mode, you’ll choose between fleeing or attacking. Opt to shoot, and you’ll rain bombs from above, sabotaging the arena floor to send enemy cars tumbling into oblivion. Choose to flee, and you’ll be the one racing for your life!\n\nOther challenges include chaotic bomb-passing rounds, where you must avoid detonation on a board packed with frantic cars.

There is a serene exhilaration of soaring when you get the hang of the controls, but it doesn't last long. You need to land! Every flight pushes your skills to the limit as you navigate unpredictable terrains and intense weather conditions. Will you make a smooth touchdown or end in a spectacular, fiery crash?\n\nHow to Play Crazy Plane Landing\n\nYour main objective in Crazy Plane Landing is to take flight, avoid obstacles, and land your plane safely. This sounds easy enough, but there is a reason some airline pilots need over a thousand hours of flight time for certification. It isn't easy!\n\nYou’ll need to master both acceleration and steering with simple game gears—hold the left mouse button, space bar, W key, or up arrow to accelerate and gain altitude, giving your plane just enough speed to soar through the skies. As you navigate, use the left mouse button or the left and right arrow keys to steer your plane on course. There are arrows pointing to the destination landing strip. Take your hand off the acceleration and steer towards the landing pad.\n\nPrecision is key—smoothly adjust your trajectory to avoid obstacles and line up your approach for a perfect landing. The right balance between speed and direction will ensure a safe landing. Don't expect too many smooth landings to begin with. This game is called \"crazy\" for a reason.\n\nYou have a few airplanes to choose from but can only upgrade once you've accumulated a significant amount of points. Upgrades are well worth all the crashes that get you accumulated points. You not only get to choose your plane, but you can upgrade engines, boosts, and bonuses.\n\nThe better the plane, the more control you have over your speed and steering.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more driving games to continue the fun. Try Moto X3M, a bike racing game with 22 levels, each of which poses a new challenge and provides the opportunity to perform wild stunts on your dirt bike, or Drift Hunters, a 3D drifting game with an excellent selection of tracks and plenty of tuned-up cars.\n\nRelease Date\nJuly 2021 (Android and iOS)\nMarch 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nMar 27, 2024\n\nControls\nHold the left mouse button / space / W / up arrow to accelerate\nUse the left mouse button / AD / right-left arrow to steer\nFAQ\nIs Crazy Plane Landing realistic?\n\nWhile you don't get a view of sitting behind the pilot's seat, the control you have during take-off and landing is quite a realistic simulation.\n\nCan you do stunts in Crazy Plane Landing?\n\nThere isn't exactly a lot of room for stunts in Crazy Plane Landing, and the aim of the game is essentially to land your airplane safely.\n\nGameplay Video",

Customize vehicles and build your own routes using an inventory with various objects. A great innovation is the ability to save the created routes and be able to reuse or share them with other users via forums or other download channels.\n\nHow to Play Wrong Way\n\nThe gameplay and driving mechanisms of this wrong-way driver game remain the same, and the graphics and game engine used are also unchanged. Try out the other games first to understand how the cars handle and how to detect a wrong turn that could potentially derail your track design.\n\nAvailable objects\n\nPlayers start with a completely blank map. The only object is the parking garages and repair center. The parking lots and repair center can be moved anywhere on the map but this is the starting point of the race. Other objects available to place include:\n\nRamps\nWarehouse units\nStraight road sections\nCorner road sections\nCrossroad sections\nT-Junction sections\nBarrels\nCrash barriers\nTrees\n\nAs you can see there is a fantastic range of objects to place - the only thing missing is a police officer to chase you whilst racing! Players can design their track safely, to create fun racing circuits. Alternatively, they can develop a course designed for mayhem and creating a range of head on collisions using the ramps.\n\nThe landscapes used are reminiscent of Southern California and driving through your creation feels like you have spent years in the United States. Next, we look at the game controls.\n\nUsing the in-game controls\n\nAt first, the game controls may feel difficult to use. The WASD keys are used to move the camera view. Moreover, use the right-click mouse button to rotate the camera.\n\nTo select an object simply click it from the toolbar menu and click it again to place it on the map. To rotate an object, first click on it - the object will turn red and a rotate and remove icon will appear.\n\nEach item can be placed and rotated individually. Road sections automatically join together which can help prevent wrong tracks being created. Ensure the road sections create a logical circuit to prevent vehicles headed in the wrong direction from crashing.\n\nAvailable vehicles\n\nOnce a player has created their map, they can test it out or share it with others. Pulling off some awesome wrong way crashes or close race finishes is a great thrill, especially on your own map. The following vehicles are available for players to drive in:\n\nMercedes AMG\nPorsche 911\nAston Martin\nNissan GT\nPick-up truck\n\nThe cars all have fantastic detail and look superb. Furthermore, they handle realistically and attain some scary top speeds.

You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

Each round, you will find yourself dropped into random locations around the globe, with only environmental clues to guide you in pinpointing your exact whereabouts. From cityscapes to rural roads, your surroundings become the puzzle pieces you need to analyze, turning each game into a thrilling geographical investigation.\n\nHow to Play Worldguessr\n\nIn Worldguessr, each game starts by placing you somewhere on Google Maps, and if you can’t immediately guess where you are, which is likely the majority of the time as you often start on obscure, long, and winding roads, you can move around to gather valuable clues. Search for nearby landmarks, coastlines, street signs, architectural styles, and other geographical features that might give away your location. Anything with a bit of language, like signs or billboards, can be especially useful, helping you narrow down your guess to a specific country or region.\n\nWorldguessr exploration goes beyond simple gameplay, offering an engaging way to enrich your geographic knowledge. Choose from hundreds of community-created maps tailored to different regions and themes, allowing you to travel from bustling metropolises to remote wildernesses. With unlimited rounds and a variety of challenges, you can play at your own pace or jump into multiplayer modes, where you’ll compete with friends or players worldwide.\n\nFor those moments when you feel completely stumped, Worldguessr offers a helpful hint feature. This hint won’t give away your exact location, but it will nudge you in the right direction by identifying the general part of the world—such as the continent—where you are. From there, the challenge is yours to explore, observe, and deduce the country, city, and even the town where you’ve been dropped, relying on your own skills to make the final call.\n\nOnce you make your guess, Worldguessr reveals just how close—or far—you were from the actual location, helping you refine your skills over time. This unique blend of learning and adventure makes Worldguessr perfect for geography enthusiasts, travelers at heart, or anyone who loves a good challenge.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will want to browse our casual games for even more of the same.

The true challenge is how easy it is for your car actually to drive across that path.\n\nNext challenge – draw a line to the target, but now there's a wall in your way. Remember, your car can’t fly! So, think about how to draw your path – you don’t have to go over the wall; you can go under it! As you go, you'll see that drawing a straight line is harder than it looks. If you don’t start the line from behind your car, it’ll just dangle off into oblivion.\n\nHow do you get over an L-shape? Or a huge gap in the ground? And the challenges keep coming. By level 5, your engine shuts off, so you’ll need your physics brain to figure out how to use hills and momentum to get across.\n\nSome levels have trampoline-like springs that’ll launch you toward your target. The challenges change each time, keeping you on your toes. Buckle up because it's going to be a bumpy ride, depending on how well you draw!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe fun has just begun!

As Commander of the A.O.D squad, you lead the charge against Mr. Ivil's ruthless thugs, determined to find the lost Inola project. With stunning isometric graphics, build your technological kingdoms and thwart the enemy's destructive ambitions. Will you save mankind or succumb to darkness?\n\nHow to Play AOD - Art of Defence\n\nYour mission in AOD Art of Defense begins with an urgent message from Mr. Ivil—find the blueprints of the fabled Inola Project at all costs—even if it means reducing the city to rubble. Time is of the essence. Meanwhile, Ich Nevel warns of an imminent large-scale assault on your bases. The stakes couldn’t be higher, and it’s up to you to defend humanity’s last hope. You have one goal - to protect your base at all costs.\n\nDynamic battles ensure that every moment is filled with action. Combining elements of Tower Defense, RPG, and tactical strategy, the game features over 500 sectors for real-time warfare, offering a variety of environments—from small villages to massive abandoned megapolises. You’ll face challenges in exciting new Tower Defense modes like escape, fog, and survival.\n\nThe aim is strategically deploying siege houses, tanks, and armed trucks to stop enemy forces before they breach your defenses. With over 1,000 tower upgrades, including tanks, miniguns, and air defense systems, your arsenal is as vast as powerful. Along the way, you’ll unlock six unique heroes, each with their own abilities to level up and master. From nuclear bombs to ionic satellite strikes and ballistic barrages, a range of devastating boosters will turn the tide in your favor.\n\nEvery successful defense wave rewards you with crystals, essential for upgrading your arsenal. The longer you survive, the greater the rewards, but enemies will become stronger with each attack. Hundreds of card upgrades allow you to customize your towers for maximum efficiency, keeping your strategies fresh and adaptable.\n\nSet in a near-future world devastated by nuclear wars, 70% of the population has been wiped out. The survivors face constant terror from Mr. Ivil, who has united gangs into a brutal army bent on finding the Inola Project blueprints. His forces leave no settlement untouched, robbing and killing indiscriminately. Your task is to stop them and save what remains of the planet.\n\nIn this endless survival mode, your tactics and preparation are key. Build your defenses wisely, place your siege houses strategically, and upgrade your resources to keep pace with the escalating challenge. Each location demands new strategies and better equipment, pushing your tactical skills to the limit.\n\nWhether you’re battling through small villages or abandoned megapolises, the world's fate depends on you. With the power of innovative weapons, unique heroes, and an array of upgrades, you hold the key to humanity’s survival.

Anything is possible in the variety of games offered. You will find yourself leaping across deadly gaps, racing through winding tracks on a speedy bike, and making daring escapes from high-security prisons. Each mode offers new thrills, so get ready to test your reflexes.\n\nHow to Play Obby World: Squid Escape\n\nObby World: Squid Escape throws is a mix of parkour challenges, with each game different from the last. Each game tests your timing, balance, and quick thinking. The game begins by letting you choose from a set of different obstacle-based modes, each with its own style and surprises.\n\nYou’ll face multiple rounds of challenges, such as:\n\nRed Light, Green Light: The classic stop-and-go test. Run when the light is green, freeze when it’s red. Move at the wrong time, and you’re out.\n\nCarousel Round: Follow the instructions: “run into a room,” “get into groups of two or three,” or “go solo.” It sounds simple, but without a way to communicate with other players, teamwork becomes tricky and tense.\n\nSkywalk Courses: Balance across oversized objects floating in the sky—giant coffee cups, donuts, chocolate bars, and more. One misstep and you’ll tumble straight down, ending your round.\n\nOther modes keep the action fresh, from racing down twisting bike tracks to sneaking through prison breakouts. Each one pushes you to react quickly and stay sharp under pressure.\n\nThe controls are simple, but the levels demand precision. One moment you’re leaping across glowing rainbow platforms, the next you’re dodging traps or trying to outsmart guards. Success depends on timing, agility, and a little creativity in how you approach obstacles.\n\nWith colorful environments, unpredictable twists, and nonstop movement, Obby World: Squid Escape is built for players who want parkour challenges that keep them on their toes.\n\nChoose your mode. In Rainbow Mode, you’ll dash across glowing platforms in a lively, colorful world. Bicycle Mode shifts the challenge to two wheels, where speed, stunts, and sharp maneuvers keep the race intense. Prison Escape raises the stakes with traps to dodge, guards to evade, and clever moves needed to break free. Each mode has its own style of thrill, and requires quick reflexes and sharp timing. Between games, you can personalize your character with outfits and accessories, giving your hero a distinct look.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like the wild antics of this game, you may like games like Eggy Car, where you have to navigate an egg in a car through obstacles, ensuring it doesn't crack!

Flying knives are generally a no-no, but in this game, they are the only way to progress to new blades and skins.\n\nSlice Master reviewed\n\nWe really enjoyed the fun tactile slicing of this game. The sounds are just perfect. I liked how the kids had to work out which mathematical operator was the best to go for at the end of the level - \"is x4 better than +60?\" Also, because you play it with just one button, it was a game that the whole family could have a go at, even from the youngest of us. In fact, our grandparents also got involved and turned out to be pretty competitive.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase\n\nHow to Play Slice Master\n\nSlice Master is a one-button game controlled by the space pad on your keyboard or the left click on your mouse. All the control lies in this one simple movement. The game has an ASMR quality, and the consistent slicing is oddly soothing to the ear.\n\nThe aim is simple: slice everything in sight: fruit, shapes, walls, furniture, and more. You can slice most things, but don’t add the white wall to your target list—it’s just a holding material for your knife.\n\nYou will get to shop along the way, using the coins accumulated to unlock sharper blades, swords, maces, and more: anything to help you slice even more!\n\nTips\nStay away from the pink spiked metal shapes. They are too strong for your knife and will take you straight back to the beginning of the round. Sometimes these can be found at the bottom of a pile of objects to slice, so be careful to lift your knife in time to avoid them\nHit the correct numeric target at the end of each level to multiply your points by the target number and boost your score.\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf casual games are your style, you can find a slew of them in our casual game category.

The higher the number, the more points you will receive, so aim high.\n\nCan I cut the white pillar in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, the white pillar can’t be cut, but you can attach it and use it as a safety net to prevent it from hitting the ground.\n\nCan I go backwards in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, you can only go forward in Slice Masters.\n\nHow many knives can I unlock in Slice Masters?\n\nYou can unlock 9 knives in Slice Masters so keep those points coming.\n\nGameplay Video",

Groove your way over and under obstacles to keep the musical momentum alive. If you slip up, it’s back to the beginning! Inspired by the original Geometry Dash, this is a Scratch version, bringing the classic rhythm-based gameplay to your browser.\n\n\"This game became our family obsession during lockdown, but we have recently returned to play it. Combining simple controls and a high level of challenge makes for a fun experience we can all enjoy. Because the play is in time with the music, it’s also a good way to develop children’s sense of timing and musicality. Sometimes we’ve even played it once the kids are in bed, to see if we can improve our skills for the next family session.\"\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Geometry Game\n\nGeometry Dash is a 2D platformer game where you are in charge of moving a shape through a bunch of obstacles, all to the beat of the music. The square actually moves by itself, and all you have to do is click to jump when necessary and use the up/down arrows to steer vehicles. The way you dodge obstacles is often in sync with the beat, so make sure your sound is on and enjoy the experience!\n\nThe key to the game is timing. The levels themselves scroll automatically, and hitting spikes, walls, or other hazards results in an instant crash and restart. If you fail, it's back to the beginning. The constant die-and-retry loop will have you quickly memorizing the patterns of each level and, more importantly, the precise timing of crucial jumps. This dynamic is what makes the game addictive.\n\nListen to the beat\n\nGeometry Game is a music game, and many jumps and movements are synced to the beat of the background music, so paying attention to the rhythm is not really an option. Practice Mode lets you place checkpoints to learn tricky sections without starting over, so it's a good place to start or go back to if you're having trouble completing levels.\n\nWatch the obstacles\n\nLevels also feature unique objects like portals, pads, and orbs. Portals can flip gravity, change speed, or switch vehicle modes. Jump pads automatically launch you, and orbs trigger special actions mid-air. These elements replace traditional power-ups, creating dynamic challenges that keep each level pretty much unpredictable.\n\nTips & Tricks\nPractice Mode. Use Practice Mode to break a level into smaller sections. Place checkpoints at tricky spots and repeat until you can clear each segment consistently. This builds muscle memory and makes full runs much easier.\nFollow the Rhythm. The game’s music often cues obstacle timing. Pay attention to beats and sync your jumps to the song. You can try humming the beat to get the rhythm down.\nGeometry Game Reviews\n\nThe game has received positive reviews from critics. Softpedia praised the game's style, saying, \"While it can get a bit frustrating sometimes, you can always complete the stages using the practice mode and then jump into the many different user-generated levels.\"\n\nGeometry Game History\n\nGeometry Dash started without a clear vision, according to the developer RobTop. It could have moved in any direction. It started as a template with a cube that could crash and jump, and evolved into the smash-hit game it is today.\n\nWhen the game was first launched, it was called Geometry Jump and only had seven levels. Later on, it was renamed \"Geometry Dash.\" Currently, there are four free versions of the game, one being \"Geometry Dash Lite,\" which now includes the first 13 levels from the full version.\n\nFeatures\nChallenging levels that vary in difficulty from hard to almost impossible\nSimple controls make the game intuitive to learn from the start\nExcellent music that compels you to reach the next part of the track\nFun gameplay synced to the beat!\nMore Geometry Games\n\nIf you like playing Geometry Dash for free in your web browser, check out Geometry Dash Subzero.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more games played in time with musical rhythms, check out FNF, a popular freestyle music game.

Every layer of the sea holds surprises, from schools of small fish to rare creatures hidden in the depths.\n\nYour goal is to cast your line as far and deep as possible. Timing is crucial. Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

But first, here’s a letter from the previous owner that will give you an idea of your situation:\n\nHi,\n\nCongrats on buying my farm! Sorry to hear you got stranded overnight - wish I could’ve helped fix your car. I don’t remember that rock being on the road… strange. Anyway, I asked around for help, and hopefully, you’ll find an oil pan soon.\n\nYou were right about the sunrises - they're stunning, much better than in the city! The soil here is top-notch too. Too bad I had to leave in such a rush. Life happens...\n\nThis land is the best spot on that flat hilltop, right near the road. It’s called Roadside Farm, but feel free to rename it. Oh, and please take care of Clarabella!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJim Grey\n\nNow that you’re settling in, it’s time to start farming. Each day brings new rewards, so be sure to check in and claim them. The key to a thriving farm is planting, harvesting, and managing your resources wisely. Sow your seeds, take care of your animals, and keep an eye on your barn and warehouse to track what you’ve gathered. As you grow your farm, you’ll have the chance to expand your land, unlocking even more opportunities to cultivate crops and raise livestock.\n\nClover is an essential crop for your animals. Cows, turkeys, and goats love it, and if you have bees, they’ll pollinate it, producing honey before harvest. Clover is also used in the production of milk, black feathers, and white feathers. Wheat is another staple: grind it at the Dutch Mill to make flour or use it to feed your sheep. It’s a key ingredient in making flour, vodka, wool, and black wool. If you need milk, make sure to feed your Holstein cows. A full cow is a happy cow, and happy cows keep your farm running smoothly.\n\nYour farm has several important buildings to manage. The Dutch Mill turns wheat into flour, and keeping it filled will power the windmill. The barn stores essentials like wheat, clover, and flour, while the warehouse holds resources such as honey, sugar, oxygen, and propane. As you progress, you’ll gain access to even more supplies, including gear, decorations, chests, and medals. Keep an eye on your stockpile to prepare for the next task.\n\nWhile ripe crops are beautiful to look at, don’t forget to harvest and replant to keep your farm productive. Wheat should always be replenished, and replanting clover on eight plots of soil will ensure a steady supply. Adding sacks of wheat to the Dutch Mill will keep your flour production running smoothly. The more you maintain your farm, the more opportunities you’ll unlock, allowing you to expand even further. Check the map to see just how vast your farm can become.\n\nBeyond the daily farm routine, there are plenty of ways to engage with the world around you. If you enjoy a relaxed farming experience, you’ll love the peaceful rhythm of planting and harvesting, accompanied by soothing animations and calming sounds. For those who like a challenge, competitions, achievements, horse racing, and leaderboards offer ways to test your skills and earn permanent prizes. The farming co-op lets you collaborate with fellow players, whether by sending Wedding Doves to ceremonies or trading produce at the Market.\n\nNeighbors are a valuable part of farm life. The more neighbors you have, the more gifts you’ll receive, helping you progress faster. You can also personalize your farm with beautiful artwork and decorations, customizing both your Farmhouse and Log Cabin. If you feel like exploring, venture into the surrounding landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots, or head to the mines to uncover valuable ores and hidden riches.\n\nWith so much to do, you can play Country Life Meadows your way. Relax and unwind with hours of farming fun, compete to showcase your skills, or grow your farm into a flourishing empire. The possibilities are endless: so start planting and watch your farm come to life!\n\nFeatures\nPlay to Relax: Unwind with hundreds of hours of farming fun.

Stay alert as other players may try to steal your progress, adding an exciting twist to the challenge. Strategize and race to complete your bridge first in this thrilling test of skill and speed!\n\nHow to Play Bridge Race\n\nBridge Race is an oddly satisfying game where you aim to collect as many blocks of your color as possible and carry them across the board to build a bridge. The objective is to create a path that leads you to the next collection area and, ultimately, to the finish line. Victory is sweet, but the challenge continues as each round gets more difficult.\n\nThe game is designed to be both simple and rewarding, with delicate sounds that create a satisfying atmosphere. You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.\n\nBut you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category title called Blob Opera, a game that uses a machine learning model trained on authentic voices to make it easy for anyone to create amazing operatic music.

Build magnificent cities, develop resources, and create a unique culture while engaging in trade and diplomacy. Expand your influence, make historic discoveries, and craft wonders that will be remembered for centuries. Your choices shape the future of your empire: lead wisely!\n\nHow to Play Empire City\n\nEmpire City is a classic management game set in ancient times where you get to build an entire city, including roadways, residential homes, waterways, workshops, and more -- all from a blank slate with a bit of help from two close advisors: Julia and Flavius.\n\nThe game starts with a full intro from Julia and Flavius, which will walk you through step by step how to build your city. Once you have the hang of it, you're on your own. But not to worry, help from your advisors is just a click away.\n\nJulia and Flavius guide you through the following directions:\n\nJulia: \"Welcome to the city, Prefect! I’m Julia. I run an inn here, and I know everything about everyone. This is Flavius, the architect.\"\n\nFlavius: \"My projects can do the talking for me! The first one is a residential building. Let’s get to work!\"\n\nJulia: \"Remember, every building in the city must be connected to a road.\"\n\nAction: You get to build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"Congratulations, Prefect! The building is ready. We can house people in it now.\"\n\nJulia: \"People?! There’s barely room for one citizen. The building needs to be upgraded.\"\n\nAction: Build a house.\n\nFlavius: \"Prefect, we have a problem. We need clay to make the house more spacious, but it’s mined outside the city.\"\n\nJulia: \"If it’s even mined at all! The clay quarry is in bad shape, and the tool storage is totally dilapidated. But our Prefect can solve that, right?\"\n\nAction: Fix the clay quarry.\n\nJulia: \"Now we can hire a manager! But that can happen later. First, we need to build a road to deliver the clay to the city.\"\n\nAction: Build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"The road is wonderful, Prefect! Collect the mined clay, and my people will deliver it to the construction site right away.\"\n\nAction: Collect the clay.\n\nFlavius: \"Thank you for the help. I’ll get to work upgrading the house right now!\"\n\nJulia: \"You and Flavius are doing wonderfully! Let’s upgrade another house. It could use a second floor, with a good view of the city.\"\n\nFlavius: \"Regular clay isn’t enough to build another floor. This requires a sturdier material, such as clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Alas, this material isn’t produced in our city. Although the Prefect could give orders to build a special workshop.\"\n\nJulia: \"If you don’t want to wait, use gems! Their shine speeds up any project. The first time is free, though.\"\n\nAction: Use gems.\n\nFlavius: \"Very grand, Prefect. Now we won’t lack building materials. Give the order to produce clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Production can take a long time. When it ends, a clay mixture icon will appear above the workshop.\"\n\nAction: Wait for production to finish.\n\nFlavius: \"It’s ready, Prefect! Tap the icon to move the mixture to the warehouse.\"\n\nAction: Move the mixture to the warehouse.\n\nJulia: \"So, are we going to upgrade the house or just pretend that it’s intentionally unfinished?\"\n\nFlavius: \"Please accept this scroll. I sketched out some improvements. Remember, Prefect, Julia and I are always here to support you!\"\n\nYou're on your own after this training. Continue building your empire and make Julia and Flavius proud, Prefect!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are in Empire City, you may like more games within our casual game category, so go ahead and have a look!

This modded version of Incredibox by NyankoBfLolCombine gives you DJ control to mix loops, vocals, beats, and melodies, pretty much creating your own musical style. The game features vibrant characters and sounds for a completely immersive experience full of rhythmic possibilities. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just love experimenting, it’s a fun and engaging way to express your creativity.\n\nHow to Play Sprunki\n\nSprunki is a quirky, surreal, music-based game that combines creativity with creepy twists. And yes, it does get a bit creepy, depending on your choices, so if horror is not your genre, then this may be a bit of a challenge.\n\nYour goal is to assemble a bizarre band of unique characters and create melodies by assigning them different outfits and accessories. Each customization changes its sound, letting you experiment with endless musical combinations.\n\nThe game starts lightheartedly as you craft a cheerful choir. Choose from avatars like TV heads, satellite dishes, and Medusa-like figures, each contributing to the band's unique vibe. The choice is all yours. There are different combinations to uncover hidden tunes, mixing cheerful beats or darker undertones, depending on your choices.\n\nAs you progress, the game takes a darker turn. Innocent melodies morph into haunting soundscapes, and your once-jolly avatars begin to appear cursed. The cheerful tree might display missing person posters, and the formerly harmonious sounds turn dissonant, with eerie visuals creeping in. The more phases you unlock, the more unsettling the game becomes, introducing new macabre characters.\n\nWhile the gameplay focuses on experimenting with sound, each phase introduces new challenges. Some characters contribute little or refuse to \"sing,\" while others evolve into grotesque forms. The gallery section teases spoilers, revealing the grim fates of your band members after each phase.\n\nUltimately, Sprunki combines rhythm game mechanics, horror elements, and surreal storytelling. Enjoy a casual game of creating bizarre beats and interesting and unexpected transformations.\n\nSprunki Gamescape\n\nSprunki has a quirky look that pretty quickly turns dark. The lighter side has a series of characters full of vibrant colors and goofy gear. The darker side turns the skies black, characters become creepy, and dissonant sounds permeate the once whimsical tunes. There is a striking contrast between cute and creepy and horror-tinged visuals and audio.\n\nSprunki Levels\n\nSprunki doesn’t have traditional levels but progresses in phases. In the early phase, the game is bright and cheerful, and it moves into later phases where the game shifts and the visuals and music become more complex and eerie.\n\nTips & Tricks\nExperiment with different character combinations to trigger secret animations or unlock bonus characters.\nLayer sounds from beats, melodies, vocals, and effects to create full, harmonious tracks.\nUse the mute/remove function to vary your composition and build dynamic songs.\nWatch visuals for subtle clues, such as flashing characters or background changes, indicating bonuses or progression.\nLeave the game idle occasionally to spot small Easter eggs or subtle animations.\nAbout Sprunki\n\nSprunki was inspired by the popular beatboxing game Incredibox, by the indie developer NyankoBfLol. The game launched in 2024 on Scratch as a spooky take on Incredibox’s musical formula, but was removed for violent and gory content. It once again gained viral attention for its hidden horror elements.\n\nIn October 2024, Sprunki became a standalone web game on CrazyGames, playable in browsers on desktops, tablets, and phones. The final update arrived in November 2024, after which the creator discontinued further development. The game nonetheless continues to thrive so much so that there are hints of a “Sprunki Remastered” project, though no release date has been announced.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category titled Blob Opera, a creative playground where you control singing blobs, each modeled after trained opera voices.

Here, you'll confront suspects with the evidence you’ve gathered, engaging in tense dialogue to uncover their true intentions. The pressure mounts as you work to discern truth from deception, and if the severity of their actions warrants it, you’ll have the authority to send them to jail.

Papa Louie proposes an exciting alternative: stay in the bustling city and open an ice cream shop! Bake delicious cookies and craft delectable sundaes with a variety of ice cream flavors. Get ready for a delightful adventure in Papa's Scooperia!\n\nPapa’s Scooperia is a classic time management game with friendly graphics and an enjoyable, familiar storyline - you’re working at an ice cream shop trying to impress customers and make tips.\n\nYou start your job at the ice cream shop with a training day. You run through the motions of taking orders, scooping cookie dough onto baking sheets, baking to perfection, adding ice cream and toppings, and serving. It's simple as that… until more and more customers come into the shop.\n\nHow customers rate your job is essential for the score. The score points accrue and increase the player’s rank. With progress in rank, you can unlock additional customers who will become regulars to the shop, as well as new ingredients, new clothes, and new furniture to enhance your “Scooperia”.\n\nThere are four different stations in Papa’s Scooperia.\n\nOrder Station\n\nThis is where customers come in and place their ice cream orders. The typical order consists of a scoop of ice cream on a freshly baked cookie, accompanied by a choice of toppings.\n\nDough Station\n\nThis is where you will make the cookies from fresh dough. Scoop up the dough and dip it in chocolate, vanilla, or color chips.\n\nBake Station\n\nNow that you have your cookie dough ready, put it in the oven. Be sure not to burn any of the cookies. When the green bars by your cookie begin blinking, you’re nearly ready to serve. Plate your cookies, click the check, and send it out to the Build Station.\n\nBuild Station\n\nNow that you have your base, the cookie, put it all together. Add your ice cream, toppings, and any other items your customer ordered. Send the ticket and ice cream out.\n\nCustomers will score you on how well you put the order together. They will also score you on how long customers have waited for their order, how well the cookie was baked, whether the toppings are right, and how well the dish is put together.\n\nAt the end of the day, you get to rest, then return and do it all over again.\n\nBonus rounds\n\nIn between baking and cooking, you’ll get the option to play some mini-rounds to gain points. Choose to skip or play.\n\nTips\n\nWhen the shop is closed, you still get some last-minute customers coming in. They’re called closers.

        "detail": "Games»Casual»Music»Friday Night Funkin'\nFriday Night Funkin'\nShare\nRating\n9.4\n(59,724 votes)\nReleased\nJanuary 2021\nTechnology\nHTML5\nPlatform\nBrowser (desktop-only)\nWiki pages\nWikipedia - Fandom\n\nCasual\n\n1,260\n\nCartoon\n\n73\n\nSkill\n\n248\n\nMusic\n\n24\n\nArt\n\n46\n\nFriday Night Funkin’ is a casual music game that combines 80s nostalgic visuals with music battles. At its heart, it’s a rap duel simulator: you take the role of Boyfriend, a determined wannabe rapper, who faces off against opponents to prove he is worthy of dating Girlfriend, who’s there the whole time, cheering you on from the speakers. The pressure is on. To be a successful rapper, you will need to follow screen prompts, perfect your timing and pattern recognition, and most importantly, never let the beat mmm drop.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Reviewed\n\nWe love dancing and music games in our family. Friday Night Funkin is a great free rhythm game where you press buttons in time with music tracks like the classic Dance Dance Revolution machines found in the 1990s arcade. The kids love it because it's silly and retro and I like the fact that it has a fan-made feel rather than the commercial dance games that cost a lot of money.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Friday Night Funkin’\n\nThe main movement in Friday Night Funkin’ is to follow the colored arrows that scroll up and down the screen. Watch for when stationary markers overlap, and press the matching arrow key (or WASD keys) as soon as you see them overlap. Seems simple enough, but the first few rounds will have you questioning your rhythm.\n\nWith every successful match, Boyfriend gets to sing. With every arrow you miss, Boyfriend’s health score drops, quickly hurting his chances of surviving, let alone winning. When you actually get to battle, this is your time to shine and belt out the tunes. If you’re not familiar with music battles, they're similar to any other type of duel competition, but with a twist: your weapons are your words and tunes. You take turns with the opponent, and sometimes you sing together in unison.\n\nYou will hear classic songs like Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero, and the objective is to sustain as many notes as possible, holding the arrows, sometimes for their entire duration. You can add variety, which is recommended, as it will boost your score if performed well. Get it wrong, and you will feel the heat on stage.\n\nDifficulty Levels\n\nDepending on your skill level as a digital singer, you can choose from three levels of difficulty in Friday Night Funkin’: easy, normal, and hard.\n\nThe more complex the level, the faster the arrows and the sequences become.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Game Modes\n\nThe demo version of Friday Night Funkin’ includes:\n\nStory Mode. This mode takes you on a music battle journey with themed “weeks” of music, each featuring three or more songs against a pretty unique opponent. To win a week, you must clear all its tracks in a row.\n\nFree Play. This mode lets you practice individual songs so you can get some solo time in the studio to get ready for the more important battles.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Story Mode\n\nIn Story Mode, you will follow Boyfriend on a weekly basis. He wants to win Girlfriend’s heart, but first must prove himself over time. Each week is designed with its own setting, opponent style, and themed soundtrack.\n\nWeek 1: Daddy Dearest, Girlfriend’s rockstar father.\nWeek 2: Skid & Pump, costumed kids from the Newgrounds series Spooky Month.\nWeek 3: Pico, an old Newgrounds mascot and Boyfriend’s hinted ex.\nWeek 4: Mommy Mearest, Girlfriend’s pop-star mother.\nWeek 5: A Christmas mall showdown with both parents and a sinister monster.\nWeek 6: Senpai, a cursed character in a retro dating sim setting.\nWeek 7: Tankman, a military parody character with sharp humor.\nWeekend 1: Pico takes the spotlight against Darnell, complete with animated cutscenes.\n\nHealth and Scoring\n\nYou have a health gauge at the bottom of the screen with a “tug-of-war” health bar. The more notes you get, the more the bar pushes toward your side. The more notes you lose, the more the bar swings toward your rival. Lose all your health, and the song ends with your head hung low. However, if you survive the track, hold it high, because that will win you the round.\n\nNow, if you know anything about performing in front of people, you know that a good performance is not about “surviving on stage” but about thriving. Each note in Friday Night Funkin’ has a score based on how accurately the note was held. Hit the note perfectly, and expect a “sick” score.\n\nSome songs are easier than others, so take advantage of those to rack up your scores. However, you will be rewarded generously for the more difficult songs.\n\nStrategies and Tips\nUse both hands to manage all the controls. Split the controls between left and right hands to hit simultaneous notes. Imagine dancing with only one foot. It’s not gonna win you a competition.\nFollow the patterns, and focus less on the arrows. When you need to mirror an opponent’s sequence, this will help.\nFollow the rhythm. Every song has a strong beat or melody. Let the rhythm guide your timing instead of relying only on visuals.\nPractice in Free Play. This is a lifesaver when it comes to more difficult songs. Practice them at a lower difficulty to master them.\nFriday Night Funkin’ Music\n\nComposed by Kawai Sprite, Friday Night Funkin’s soundtrack will have you moving and grooving in your swivel chair from the get-go. Each week brings a distinct style of music from funky hip-hop to spooky organ synths, electro-pop club beats, and even militaristic chiptune rock. This is a crash course in funk.\n\nYou may be familiar with a few of the tracks, like “M.I.L.F” and “Ugh” that became a viral sensation online.\n\nOngoing Development\n\nFNF is an open-source game with an active development community and plenty of fan-made mods that expand the gameplay. In addition to mods made by avid fans, the developers recently added week 7 to the game and plan on turning it into a 'full-ass game' at some point in the future.\n\nFriday Night Funkin is not available on mobile devices yet, but it will be at some point in the future since the Kickstarter got funded! This version of the game is open-source on GitHub and available under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nRhythm games are great fun to play solo or with your friends.

Whether you choose free-for-all or team deathmatch, your goal is to survive and dominate. You will need to customize your arsenal, up your game plan, and outpace your rivals in every fight. It's non-stop action for the start.\n\nHow to Play Fragen\n\nIn Fragen, you take on the role of a soldier in full combat gear, ready to fight your way through an abandoned complex filled with enemies. As you roam, you’ll face shooters everywhere, so stay alert. Switch between close-range and long-range guns depending on your position, and always keep an eye both ahead and over your shoulder.\n\nStart by choosing either a solo or team battle, then pick your mode. Solo battle options include free-for-all, sniper only, or secondary weapon only. Team battle offers modes like team deathmatch, gun race, sniper only, and secondary only.\n\nThe game features a battle pass where you can earn skins, gear upgrades, and exclusive rewards.

You'll understand the concept if you're familiar with the Bodycam game. Enter the battlefield and enjoy a unique gaming experience! BodyCamera Shooter offers ultra-realistic first-person shooter action directly in your browser and on your phone.\n\nHow to Play BodyCamera Shooter\n\nThe goal of a BodyCamera Shooter is to stay alive by neutralizing threats and surviving waves of enemies in unfamiliar territory. The emphasis is often on tactical decision-making, realism, and immersion, with a strong focus on precision and careful movement. You must navigate through environments, often with limited resources and visual awareness, to complete these objectives while maintaining your own survival.\n\nThe key to this game is combined reaction time and precision. There are numerous moves to make, and uncertainty greatly outweighs tactical precision, forcing you to adapt and react quickly to unpredictable situations. WASD or arrow keys will navigate your player, but your strength lies in using your keypad or mouse to aim and shoot.\n\nFocus on mastering movement while aiming and shooting at first. You'll likely get killed while practicing this, but it is hard to move on to more skillful moves until this is down pat.\n\nOnce you gain a bit of momentum, incorporate a bit of running (shift key) and jumping (space bar) to avoid enemy fire and navigate your surroundings more quickly.\n\nThe R key will be vital once you master your craft; it will reload your weapon quickly. Use this when surrounded by enemy fire to avoid wasting time with automatic reloads.\n\nYou can upgrade your soldier through six different levels, each corresponding to a new weapon that will be unlocked as you progress through the levels.\n\nThere are four different scenarios for the combat: the first two will be available immediately, while to access the Counter-Strike looking map, you will have to reach level 5, and the last one will only be accessible after reaching level 10.\n\nFPS perspective\n\nGame graphics are hyper-realistic and will get your adrenaline pumped. The gameplay is sometimes so real that you question whether the graphics were based on realistic scenarios and scenery.\n\nThe bodycam is positioned at chest level, providing a more realistic field of view, although it is still relatively limited due to the nature of your environment. You can use surrounding sounds as guidance, but you’re more likely to hear your footsteps than your opponents. The fish-eye view is a remarkable feature of this game, and adapting to it will be a key to the success you’ll achieve in this game.\n\nFeatures\nRealistic controls and graphics\nJuicy effects\nA variety of weapons\nWell-developed levels\nLeaderboard\nDynamic gameplay\nSmooth animations\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many exciting FPS and shooting games to check out! Krunker offers fast-paced action with various maps and modes. DEADSHOT.io challenges your aim and reflexes in a fierce online arena for even more intensity.\n\nTry a different kind of shooting experience with Bubble Shooter or Idle Breakout.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJuly 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 13, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = move\nShift = run\nSpace = jump\nC = sit down\nLeft-click = shoot\nRight-click = aim\nR = reload\n1, 2, 3 / mouse wheel = switch weapon\nTab = pause\nFAQ\nIs Bodycamera Shooter single player?\n\nBodycamera Shooter is a single-player game, played against computer opponent.\n\nCan you play Bodycamera Shooter on PC?\n\nYou can play Bodycamera Shooter online at CrazyGames in your browser.\n\nGameplay Video"

As the city falls into chaos, your mission is to uncover the cause of the apocalypse and fight to survive. Upgrade your weapons, buy new guns, and improve your skills to increase your chances. Play through different modes like sniper missions, survival challenges, and resource exploration. Dive into the intense horror of this post-apocalyptic world and battle to stay alive!\n\nHow to Play Death City: Zombie Invasion\n\nYou and your small crew have reached the bitter end—the zombie apocalypse is here, and survival is your only option. Huddled around a flickering fire, you plan your attack, surrounded by hordes of undead in a brutal, kill-or-be-killed world.\n\nZombies are everywhere, easily spotted by their eerie blue forms, and you’ll be fighting them on a full 360-degree battlefield. Keep your head on a swivel—while you're battling enemies in front, they can sneak up from behind. If you take too many hits, it’s game over, and you’ll know you’re in trouble when the red glow around you starts closing in.\n\nFollow the arrows and prompts—they’ll lead you to the essential resources you need to stay alive. But your biggest enemy? Reloading time. Those critical moments can leave you vulnerable to swarms of zombies, so make every shot count.\n\nIt’s you and a few brave souls against a world overrun by zombies. From a bird’s-eye view, you’ll see the cities you need to reclaim on your road to freedom. Prepare for intense missions in terrifying places like End of the World, Rush Time, Out of Inferno, Forest Danger, and Be Full of Peril. Each location will push you to the brink, with unique challenges and different characters to play.\n\nLucky Spin\n\nTake your chances with the Lucky Spin wheel to snag crucial resources like DNA, medicine, coins, and diamonds. But don’t get too greedy—you’ll need to watch ads if you over-spin, and there’s a cooldown period to keep things balanced.\n\nUpgrades\n\nArm yourself for the battle of your life by upgrading to powerful assault rifles, grenades, and faster-firing weapons. Pay close attention to your weapon’s stats—damage, speed, reload time, and accuracy—because as you dive deeper into the chaos, every advantage counts.\n\nWith danger lurking at every turn, it's up to you to upgrade, strategize, and fight your way through hordes of the undead. Will you conquer the apocalypse, or will the zombies claim your last breath?\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant a bit more fright to your night?

Your mission is to track and hunt various wild animals, including bears, crocodiles, deer, buffalo, and wolves. With 100 challenging levels set across three distinct game worlds such as dense forests, icy tundras, and arid deserts, you'll experience a variety of environments that test your skills and strategy.\n\nHow to Play Wild Hunter 3D\n\nStep into the wild and take on the role of a skilled hunter. Each hunt presents different animals to track and shoot, but the rugged landscape makes them difficult to spot. Staying alert is key, as the terrain provides plenty of cover for your targets.\n\nYour hunting goals appear in the top-left corner, showing how many deer, boars, or other animals you need to hunt. Completing these objectives earns reward points, and after each successful shot, you’ll see a distance meter displaying how far you were from the target. You can move around to find a better position, but the most rewarding shots come from a distance.\n\nPrecision is everything. If you miss, the animal will be startled and run, making it much harder to hit. Moving targets requires skill, and a poorly timed shot could turn the hunt against you. If an animal becomes aware of your presence, it might charge, and a wild boar stampede could end the round instantly.\n\nTo improve your aim, you can adjust both general sensitivity and scope sensitivity. Moving closer may give you an easier shot, but true hunters thrive on long-range accuracy. Survive 100 rounds, master the wild, and prove yourself as the ultimate hunter.\n\nSharpen your aim, manage your resources, and prepare for the thrill of the hunt in Wild Hunter 3D!\n\nFeatures\nRewards for successful hunts to enhance your gameplay.\nA selection of 5 weapon types is available in the in-game store.\nRealistic animal behaviors, such as fear and escape.\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our vast selection of shooting games, including Squirrel With a Gun, a quirky arcade shooting where you take on the role of a checkered squirrel armed with awesome weaponry and acrobatic moves; choose your character and fight in pixelated FPS showdowns Pixel Gun 3D; or Hazmob FPS Online Shooter, a multiplayer shooting FPS game where every second counts.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun. There is also plenty of variation in our puzzle category, with games like Word Search and 2048.\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play and interact with all the in-game buttons.\n\nFAQ\nHow do you upgrade furniture in Open House?\n\nYou can clean up your dream home gone wrong in Open House by playing match-3 rounds to earn enough to get new home furnishings.\n\nIs Open House a mobile friendly game?\n\nOpen House is a mobile-friendly game, so you can decorate and play match-3 puzzles on the go.\n\nGameplay Video"

There are no shuffles, and the game is timed, but the game's pace is relaxed.\n\nHow to Play Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nSpot the patterns\n\nMahjong is a tricky puzzle game. There are so many tiles, many of which look the same but feature slight differences. Along with the need to spot these patterns, you can’t move any pieces with both sides blocked. The left or right side needs to be accessible, at least.\n\nFinding a couple of “free” tiles is the challenge here, with a tile-free being when there are no tiles on top of it. In addition, either its left or right side needs to be open. In this version of Mahjong Solitaire, you can look at the top of your screen to understand how many pairs of tiles are “free” to be matched, plus you can match the special tiles, those with a colored background, anytime.\n\nUse hints when you’re stuck\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features hints if you get stuck, but unlike some other mahjong games, it does not have a shuffle feature. The games are also timed, meaning there is some urgency to how many tiles you can match.\n\nWhen the game ends, you’ll get a score for the tiles you matched and a bonus for how far you got in the game before your time ran out.\n\nTile groups in Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features 144 tiles divided primarily into three suits. The primary suits are:\n\nDots - feature circles\nBamboo - feature lines\nCharacters - feature Chinese characters\n\nIn Mahjongg Solitaire, you’ll also notice special tiles that can be matched even without the same image. These are highlighted in blue or green.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nMahjong Solitaire is an excellent choice for both beginners and regular Mahjong enthusiasts. However, there are many other titles in our collection of Mahjong games. Other puzzle games you may like include board games such as 2048, Rummikub, and Ludo.\n\nRelease Date\n\nOctober 2016\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile). We also have the Android version.\n\nLast Updated\n\nAug 03, 2022\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact.\n\nFAQ\nIs it spelled mahjong or mahjongg?\nBoth words are correct and are used to describe the same game.\nIs Mahjongg Solitaire a difficult game?\nMahjong is generally a tricky game, but this is probably a medium-difficulty mahjong game compared with others. There are no shuffles, but you have 10 minutes and unlimited hints which balances the game nicely.\nIs Mahjong Solitaire a free game?\n\nYes, you can play Mahjong Solitaire online for free at CrazyGames.\n\nIs Mahjong good for the brain?\n\nPuzzle games are often cited as keeping the mind sharp and maintaining brain health.\n\nGameplay Video"

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

Stop the dragons from reaching your castle by building your defenses through tactical tile-matching decisions.\n\nHow to Play\nBuild your defenses\n\nMatch 3 pieces of the same resource to upgrade them to a weapon or defense piece. When you have 3 of the same weapon or wall beside each other, you can merge them to create more powerful units. However, merging also means less coverage over the map, so sometimes you should delay the decision to merge.\n\nProtect your castle\n\nYou have a limited number of swaps available before the dragons attack, so you have to use them wisely. Position your defenses so you can weather the attack! Before the boss round the game will show an arrow indicating the area where the drag will appear. Day 10 and day 20 are the first boss dragon levels, so you need to be prepared. Once you kill a boss, they release a large number of smaller dragons.\n\nCombine resources\n\nCombine 3 of these resources to build the following defenses:\n\nStone - creates a defensive attack tower\nGunpowder - builds a cannon\nIce - creates an ice wall\nLogs - creates an attack turret\nGold - forms a chest containing swaps and sometimes other items like TNT and anvils to immediately upgrade resources.\n\nAll of the created defenses above can then be merged again to build an even more powerful unit.\n\nSign up and join a clan\n\nIt's worth signing up for an account in Tower Swap! It is a simple process and will allow you to build a custom avatar using extensive options, join a clan to compete, earn gold, and unlock chests with rewards. At the end of each game you'll receive gold coins that you can use to buy lives and open chests early.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nTower Swap is a unique game that combines elements from match-3 games and tower defense games.

Begin in a fog-covered land, using ancient keys to explore hidden realms and trace the path of your lost family through different eras. Discover mysterious lands and piece together an enchanting legacy.\n\nHow to Play Castle Craft\n\nStep into the wonderous world of Castle Craft, where you play as farmer Fiona, determined on her heartfelt mission to reunite with her husband after a mysterious separation. Your adventure begins in a simple garden, where you combine garden beds and plants to breathe new life into the land—this is the merge element of the game. As you cultivate your wheat fields, you will harvest crops to trade for mystical keys that dispel the fog, revealing hidden territories and secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nAs Fiona restores the land, her journey takes her toward new clues about her husband Michael’s whereabouts, such as his misplaced headphones, and she encounters friendly helpers along the way. Among them is Aiden, a kind woodsman who helps her clear obstacles like a stubborn tree stump. Together, Fiona and Aiden gather timber and merge logs to create essential tools and craft materials, unlocking treasure chests filled with valuable rewards to continue on her quest.\n\nEvery decision you make shapes Fiona’s path, allowing her to rebuild and expand her world. What begins as a small garden evolves into a thriving medieval kingdom, complete with bustling marketplaces and grand castles. As you progress, the adventure deepens, introducing new lands teeming with hidden treasures, mysterious puzzles, and historical figures who assist in unraveling the mysteries of time and family.\n\nTo embark on this journey, start by merging three wheat sprouts to cultivate a full wheat crop, then continue merging similar items to develop the garden further. Harvest the wheat to trade for keys that unlock new areas, dispelling the fog and revealing untapped potential. Treasure chests, once opened, offer unique items and heroes to aid Fiona in reclaiming and revitalizing the land. Each merge brings you closer to tracing your family’s footsteps through history and unraveling the secrets of the past.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our adventure category for more fun titles.

Start by drilling deep into the Earth’s crust, extracting valuable minerals and hidden treasures.\n\nWith each click, you’ll uncover riches that can be sold to fund the expansion and upgrading of your mining operations. As your business grows, you’ll be able to unlock new technologies and hire workers to dig even deeper, inching ever closer to the Earth’s core.\n\nHow to Play Mister Mine\n\nThe goal of the game is to mine for resources. The deeper you go, the greater the rewards. Mine deeper underground to obtain more resources and minerals to sell. You'll also encounter treasure chests the further you dig. These chests contain random rewards from small to vast amounts of money and resources.\n\nUnlike your typical idle game, Mister Mine requires active participation from players. This is evident in two ways: miners must find stones or minerals that require clicking, and players will encounter Bosses in the mines' depths that need to be fought back. You also need to monitor closely the percentage of capacity you reach. Once it’s at 100% your miners will stop working, so you’ll need to either sell all or some of your resources or use them to build or upgrade your tools.\n\nYour miners will be digging through 3 different worlds:\n\nEarth, up to 1032 km of depth\nMoon, from 1032 to 1132 km of depth\nTitan, after 1132 km of depth.\nComplete quests\n\nThere are 112 different quests to complete, each of which will give you a different reward, enabling you to improve your business further.\n\nUpgrade your gear\n\nYou start the game with a humble shovel for digging. As you earn enough currency, you can upgrade your digging methods, progressing from a shovel to a jackhammer, and then to a drill, and finally to a nuclear excavator. Beyond that point, upgrades get supernatural, replacing workers with aliens and demons!\n\nHidden gems\n\nDig until km 50 to encounter the Golem (talking to it is one of the quests!) and reach km 400 to meet the first of six Earth bosses.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our clicker games for many more addictive idle and clicker titles.\n\nOther popular games include Idle Breakout and Little Alchemy.\n\nDeveloper\n\nPlaysaurus developed Mr. Mine.\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nSteam\nAndroid\nControls\n\nLeft mouse button\n\nFAQ\nHow do I get tickets in Mr. Mine?\n\nYou can get tickets from the following places:\n\nCaves (x1)\nQuests\nTrading (x1, x2)\nGold treasure chests\nExcavations\nDonating\nHow can I get building materials in Mr. Mine?\n\nThe main source for building materials is caves.

Go on an epic adventure and slay monsters, upgrade heroes with the gold you collect, find treasures, and kill bosses. Clicker Heroes is a game that helped propel clicker games into the mainstream alongside other classics like Idle Breakout.\n\nHow to Play\nClick to kill\n\nEmbark on a quest to become a powerful warrior. Strike down each beast you see by clicking them repeatedly, then reap the gold rewards left behind. Every click you make has a single damage value that you can continuously upgrade for more power.\n\nHire heroes to help\n\nHire different heroes to help you take down monsters faster. Every hero has their own DPS and a set of upgrades that are sometimes unique. Often the hero upgrades allow further significant increases to their DPS. Heroes allow you to kill enemy mobs and take gold without lifting a finger.\n\nThe heroes get progressively more expensive, but you get what you pay for in strength and powerful upgrades. The further you get, the more heroes emerge, becoming your next big purchase that allows you to move further into more lucrative lands.\n\nExplore new lands and beat bosses\n\nEach region has new and exciting monsters to fight. Start at the forest and progress into drylands and other locations. At the end of each region, there is a difficult boss fight - the boss has extra health and takes all your might to vanquish! If you fail to beat the boss, you’ll bounce back to the previous stage where you can build your skills further before entering the fight again.\n\nDeveloper\n\nClicker Heroes is developed by Playsaurus.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJuly 2014. The web version can be played exclusively on CrazyGames!\n\nPlatforms\n\nClicker Heroes is available as a web browser game, Android game, and iOS game.

Create your team from over 50 unique heroes, each inspired by iconic characters you know and love. Dive into intense real-time PvP battles where your skills and tactics are put to the ultimate test. Join forces with fellow guild players to take on epic quests across breathtaking locations, from ancient ruins to mystical landscapes. As you progress, you can upgrade your heroes and gear, enhancing their abilities and unlocking new powers.\n\nHow to Play Battle Arena\n\nIn a world overrun by demons, you must choose a region at a time to combat your opponent. Battle Arena fights start off in Serenity Valley, where you can assess your enemy's squad in just a tap. You get to select your heroes for battle. You begin with only three heroes to play with, each with a different weapon and skill. But the amount of heroes you can eventually upgrade to is countless.\n\nEarly in the game, you will fight Dark Lord, who is less than happy to see you. To win the initial battle and every one afterward, you must use your hero's unique skills—some wield swords while others shoot arrows. Just tap on their avatars at the bottom of the screen to strengthen your attacks.\n\nIn Battle Arena, your objective is pretty much to build and upgrade your heroes and compete in various challenges, particularly in the arena. The gameplay revolves around gathering resources and gaining experience points to level up. Players can participate in raids to acquire new heroes and enhance their existing ones. The key to success in this game is to strategize by selecting the right battle heroes to maximize team effectiveness.\n\nAs you engage in battles, you must use different abilities and relics, which provide unique advantages during combat. Upgrading heroes is crucial to improve your performance in battles.\n\nAlways pay attention to your heroes' health and manage resources wisely, especially during expeditions and arena fights. Using a mix of heroes with complementary skills can lead to successful team combinations and help defeat stronger opponents.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to push through the ranks in the arena by strategizing hero placements and leveraging their abilities effectively. You can earn significant rewards as you progress, which can be reinvested into your hero roster.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore a wide array of adventure games at your fingertips!

You’ll have to solve tricky puzzles and face unpredictable mini-games throughout your escape attempt to get to freedom. Outsmart the odds and the guards, and you will be well on your way out of prison.\n\nHow to Play Prison Escape\n\nYou are stuck in a prison, the last place you want to be. Your goal is to plan and carry out a successful escape without being caught by the guards.\n\nYou start with a key, but it is not for your cell. The key you need to get out is in the next cell, and the only way in is through the toilet pathway. To enter, you must quietly unscrew the toilet bolts. Be careful because if you make too much noise, the guards will hear you. A “caught meter” shows how loud you are.\n\nLook under the bench to find a fork. Move the bench quietly, then use the fork as a screwdriver to remove the toilet bolts. Once the toilet is loose, move it aside and crawl through the vent into the next cell. In the next cell is Rhino, a tough inmate who will call the guards if he spots you. You must convince him not to by beating him in an arm wrestling match. Give it your all because your life depends on it.\n\nEscaping requires moving through multiple rooms, each with its own challenges. Some cellmates are not friendly, but their brute strength can be useful. Some can even break down walls, which could help you find a way out.\n\nGather useful tools like forks, keys, and lockpicks to aid in your escape plan. If you get stuck, do not hesitate to use hints, especially for tricky lockpicking. Always stay hidden when guards are near. If guards spot you, quickly find places to hide, including other prison cells, to avoid capture.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to reach the safe. Inside is a gun, which can level the playing field against the guards. Find a silencer, too, or one loud shot will immediately trigger alarms. Guards are not your only obstacle. Make it far enough, and you will face a dangerous series of alligators blocking your path. How far can you get? Can you escape prison alive?\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nPuzzle games can be quite thrilling, which is why we have a whole collection dedicated to them, all online and free to play!

The first break will tell you whether you are stripes or solids, depending on what ball you get in the pocket first.\n\nIn each turn, aim to strike the cue ball to hit your target ball into a pocket. If successful, you continue your turn; otherwise, your opponent takes their turn. The key is to use strategic shots to position the cue ball for the next play and try to control the table by positioning balls to your advantage. The direction of where your ball will land is outlined from the stick to the ball with an arrow, giving you an indication of the target path.\n\nThe player who pots all their balls first wins the game.\n\nChoose from numerous game rooms such as a private two-player game between you and your friend, a quick play game where you choose your level and play against the public quickly, or a local play where you may need to wait a bit to be matched with a live partner.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you want to explore more sports games online, browse our selection of popular titles, which include Basketball Stars, Basket Random, Backyard Baseball, A Small Word Cup, and more.\n\nRelease Date\n\nAugust 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nControls\n\nPC\n\nPress and hold the left mouse button, then drag to adjust power.

Use move keys to dodge enemy punches and hit back with random punch combinations. You can play against another player or AI.\n\nHow to Play Punchers\n\nPunchers throws players into the boxing ring for an intense boxing match where technique is key. Use the WASD keys to maneuver your fighter and get ready to throw jabs, cross punches, and more. The game features both realistic real-time matches as well as slow-motion combat, allowing players to perfect their moves and time their punches with precision.\n\nYou’ll be scored on total punches, landed punches, power punches, and accuracy. While you can spam the keys, success depends on skill and precision rather than random attacks. Take advantage of slow-motion mode to practice your moves and learn the timing needed for effective jabs and cross punches.\n\nEach punch has a recovery move, meaning you need to manage your timing carefully. Too many reckless attacks can leave you open for counter-punches. A stamina meter tracks your energy, helping you decide when to go on the offense or focus on defense to recover.\n\nAfter each round, you’ll get feedback on your performance, including stats like your best punch and overall effectiveness. If you win, expect a fun celebration with cheers, but if you lose, brace yourself for a bit of frustration.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore other exciting sports titles including popular soccer games like Soccer Random, a chaotic 2-player soccer game with bouncy physics and one-button controls, or Basket Random, where you bounce around and battle for the ball across various crazy basketball courts If you want to change the sport and try your luck at archery, Bowman, a game where you and an opponent take shots at each other.

How many will you slay before you fall?\n\nHow to Play EvoWars.io\n\nEmbark on an epic quest across the digital battlefield, where you’ll collect powerful orbs to evolve your warrior into unstoppable forms. As you slash through enemies with swords, axes, and a brutal arsenal of weapons, each battle pushes you closer to becoming the ultimate warrior. With more than 15 unique character models to unlock, your journey is one of constant evolution and power.\n\nYou control a constantly advancing warrior with your mouse, swinging your weapon to defeat enemies and collect XP to evolve into stronger forms with bigger weapons and greater attack range. As you play, you'll unlock more evolutions and customize your warrior with different weapons and gear to eliminate all other fighters on the field while growing stronger.\n\nAs you accumulate points, you will be able to upgrade gameplay dynamics. It will take some time to reach your desired destination. It's not the easiest game to master.\n\nThe key to this 2D top-down game is winning battles. Each victory allows you to grow stronger, but the battlefield isn’t just about brute strength; you’ll need to define your play style and use every opportunity to outmaneuver your enemies.

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down. There is a very generous reward system that incentivizes players to keep coming back, and the community in the rooms is constantly rotating, which makes each room a completely new social adventure.\n\nGameplay Video"

It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items!

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

You control one of these weapon-wielding eggs in one of four online game modes where the aim is to shatter your opponents with bullets and bombs. It's the ultimate online egg shooting game!\n\nKids love games where they shoot other players. Whatever you think about guns this seems to always be the case. We let our children play Shell Shockers before the older rating games with guns because it's a less violent way to have fun online. In fact, they enjoyed it so much that even though they are older they still go back to play this again and again.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Shell Shockers\n\nJump into the game and select your character name, customize your egg,  and choose one of four game modes. In this game, you must work hard to protect yourself and dish out damage to opposing eggs. Try out each game mode and see if you can conquer the Shell Shockers arena. \n\nTips and tricks\nPlay tactically\nAct quickly\nCollect egg ammunition\nThink like an egg\nGame modes\nTeams\n\nJoin a team (either red or blue) and fight against the enemy eggs until your team has the most kills collectively.\n\nFree For All\n\nEvery egg for themselves. If you see an egg, you shoot. Unless you want to be scrambled yourself. There is only one winner in this mode.\n\nCaptula the Spatula\n\nTwo teams battle for control of the spatula. The team with the spatula earns points for kills, but these can be lost if the player holding the spatula dies.\n\nKing of the Coop\n\nKing of the Coop was added in December 2021 with a host of cosmetic items and a new map. Two teams battle to capture a defined area known as the coop. The players on the winning team get 250 golden eggs each!\n\nWeapons\n\nThere are seven main weapon types in Shell Shockers. Each weapon has its advantages and drawbacks. If you have eggcellent aim, a weapon like the Crackshot would be great. If you’re more of a spray-and-pray type, try out the Whipper. The complete weapon list for Shell Shockers is:\n\nEggK-47 - classic medium-range automatic\nScrambler - high-damage shotgun\nFree Ranger - semi-automatic sniper rifle\nRPEGG - huge damage RPG\nWhipper - close to medium range rapid-fire rifle\nCrackshot - bolt-action sniper rifle\nTriHard - accurate medium-range burst-fire rifle\n\nAdditionally, each player has an additional gun and can pick up grenades from the map.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe game uses Golden Eggs as currency; you can use them to upgrade the way your character appears in the game or the weapons it uses. Mind you, using the Golden Eggs in the shop won’t allow you to buy items that give you an advantage during combat.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more online shooting games, check out our multiplayer io games and browse the selection, which includes the highly popular Agar io.\n\nIf you are looking for something totally different, consider trying Bubble Shooter or 2048.\n\nFeatures\nFast-paced FPS gameplay\nA unique theme centered around eggs\nVarious weapons and game modes \nEgg customization and a shop for more items\nDeveloper\n\nShell Shockers is developed by Blue Wizard Digital (formerly known as the Egg and Dairy Ministry of Belarus).

Gather resources, build your base, and evolve through upgrades while battling rivals and their creatures.\n\nHow to Play Taming.io\nCraft and Upgrade\n\nIn the beginning, it’s just you and your pet. You can choose to spawn besides a wolf, a rabbit or a bear. You should quickly start harvesting resources to defend yourself, attack others and generate additional future resources.\n\nYou can collect four different types of goods:\n\nWood\nStone\nFood\nGold\n\nWood and Stone are essential to create tools and weapons, but also to build your base and the defensive structures supporting it.\n\nFood is useful to heal and to recover stamina, while gold is used to buy equipment, but it also contributes to your score.\n\nAs you start your harvest, you begin aging and each time you age, you’ll receive a selection of rewards that boost your capabilities as a survivor. These rewards can be anything from food items to recovery health, tools, and weapons.\n\nWaste no time getting started. Start building your fortress and fortify it with walls and turrets. One of the most important buildings to unlock for your base is the windmill. This structure generates gold for you automatically.\n\nTame Pets\n\nThe unique angle of Taming is the pet battles. You can choose from a selection of pets at the start, but you can also tame up to two additional wild animals. The primary method for discovering new beasts to tame is to locate wild baby animals on the map; these are often found sleeping. There is no guarantee that the animal you are approaching will be happy to be tamed, but you can increase your chances of success by using items like apples and stones, which give you a 1% boost to tame certain animals.\n\nYou can also equip yourself with special gear, like the Tamer’s Cap and the Luck Hat, as well as a dedicated tool that shoots apples, aptly named the Appletor, to have more opportunities to tame animals.\n\nAny animal has a magical type, and there are four different types of magic in Taming.io:\n\nFire\nWater\nPlant\nElectric\n\nTry to build a squad of pets with complementary magic types to increase your chances of success in this game.\n\nBuild a Team\n\nSince Taming is a multiplayer .io game, you share the world with numerous other gamers. It’s a good idea to get in touch with some of them to form a team. Doing it alone will be more challenging as you face other teams and higher-level players who will dominate you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nTaming.io is similar to other multiplayer io games, such as Agar io.\n\nA different approach to playing with animal-like creatures is found in Sprunki, where you use them to create music. Another musical game on CrazyGames, although unrelated to the world of animals, is Friday Night Funkin’.\n\nFeatures\nFight magical battles with other players\nTame wild animals to fight for you\nCollect various resources \nBuild and fortify your base\nUnlock more rewards as you age\nRelease Date\n\nNovember 2020\n\nDeveloper\n\nLapaMauve developed Taming.io.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 24, 2023\n\nControls\nWASD or ZQSD or arrow keys to move\nLeft mouse button to attack\nFAQ\nHow do you chat in Taming.io?\n\nYou can press the enter key to open chat.\n\nWhat is the strongest pet in Taming.io?\n\nNo pet stands out as the strongest. Some top choices are the Black Cat, Armadillo, and Ice Fairy.\n\nWhat can you play Taming.io on?\n\nTaming.io, it can be played on mobile, desktop, and tablet. You can enjoy this Io game from most devices.\n\nWhat is the weakest pet in Taming io?\n\nNormal types are considered the weakest and least effective in the game.\n\nGameplay Video"

With a multitude of levels to explore, each one introduces new challenges and exciting obstacles that test your creativity and strategic thinking. Draw your way to victory and see how far your creativity can take you!\n\nHow to Play Doodle Road\n\nYou start in Doodle Road by practicing drawing a straight line from the car to the target. Sounds simple, right? Wait until you see how straight your line really is! The true challenge is how easy it is for your car actually to drive across that path.\n\nNext challenge – draw a line to the target, but now there's a wall in your way. Remember, your car can’t fly! So, think about how to draw your path – you don’t have to go over the wall; you can go under it! As you go, you'll see that drawing a straight line is harder than it looks. If you don’t start the line from behind your car, it’ll just dangle off into oblivion.\n\nHow do you get over an L-shape? Or a huge gap in the ground? And the challenges keep coming. By level 5, your engine shuts off, so you’ll need your physics brain to figure out how to use hills and momentum to get across.\n\nSome levels have trampoline-like springs that’ll launch you toward your target. The challenges change each time, keeping you on your toes. Buckle up because it's going to be a bumpy ride, depending on how well you draw!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe fun has just begun!

Anything is possible in the variety of games offered. You will find yourself leaping across deadly gaps, racing through winding tracks on a speedy bike, and making daring escapes from high-security prisons. Each mode offers new thrills, so get ready to test your reflexes.\n\nHow to Play Obby World: Squid Escape\n\nObby World: Squid Escape throws is a mix of parkour challenges, with each game different from the last. Each game tests your timing, balance, and quick thinking. The game begins by letting you choose from a set of different obstacle-based modes, each with its own style and surprises.\n\nYou’ll face multiple rounds of challenges, such as:\n\nRed Light, Green Light: The classic stop-and-go test. Run when the light is green, freeze when it’s red. Move at the wrong time, and you’re out.\n\nCarousel Round: Follow the instructions: “run into a room,” “get into groups of two or three,” or “go solo.” It sounds simple, but without a way to communicate with other players, teamwork becomes tricky and tense.\n\nSkywalk Courses: Balance across oversized objects floating in the sky—giant coffee cups, donuts, chocolate bars, and more. One misstep and you’ll tumble straight down, ending your round.\n\nOther modes keep the action fresh, from racing down twisting bike tracks to sneaking through prison breakouts. Each one pushes you to react quickly and stay sharp under pressure.\n\nThe controls are simple, but the levels demand precision. One moment you’re leaping across glowing rainbow platforms, the next you’re dodging traps or trying to outsmart guards. Success depends on timing, agility, and a little creativity in how you approach obstacles.\n\nWith colorful environments, unpredictable twists, and nonstop movement, Obby World: Squid Escape is built for players who want parkour challenges that keep them on their toes.\n\nChoose your mode. In Rainbow Mode, you’ll dash across glowing platforms in a lively, colorful world. Bicycle Mode shifts the challenge to two wheels, where speed, stunts, and sharp maneuvers keep the race intense. Prison Escape raises the stakes with traps to dodge, guards to evade, and clever moves needed to break free. Each mode has its own style of thrill, and requires quick reflexes and sharp timing. Between games, you can personalize your character with outfits and accessories, giving your hero a distinct look.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like the wild antics of this game, you may like games like Eggy Car, where you have to navigate an egg in a car through obstacles, ensuring it doesn't crack!

Your mission is to evolve your character into an unstoppable force by unlocking powerful upgrades, mastering epic combos, and unleashing devastating fatalities that will destroy your foes. Conquer waves of enemies with precision and skill as you dominate each battle. Only after crushing every opponent will you unlock the portal to the next level, where even more significant challenges await. Sharpen your reflexes, perfect your strategies, and prove you have what it takes.\n\nHow to Play Stick Epic Fighter\n\nYou begin in a classic arcade-style side-scrolling screen, where you’ll quickly get accustomed to the game’s controls. Use the up arrow to jump, the down arrow to attack, and the left and right arrows for movement. Before long, you’ll encounter enemies—attack them by holding the down arrow to unleash a series of sword strikes. Holding down the attack key continuously lets you deliver multiple hits, which is essential since enemies require several strikes to be defeated.\n\nThough you can jump and sprint past enemies to reach the end of the level quickly, you won’t be able to progress to the next round until all foes are eliminated. If you leave any behind, you’ll have to backtrack and take them out. Once every enemy is defeated, and you reach the final portal, your stickman will celebrate with a happy dance, signaling that you’ve successfully cleared the level!\n\nAs you advance, the difficulty ramps up with more enemies and tougher challenges, so stay alert and fast on your feet! Use the arrows for guidance on enemy locations and areas you may have missed. Throughout the course, prompts will also direct you to jump to high platforms or descend into lower areas.\n\nEach round rewards you with points that can be used to purchase upgrades, boosting your power and making it easier to defeat stronger enemies. Plus, you can customize your stickman by changing skins, giving your hero a fresh look as you fight your way through each increasingly intense round!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nKeep the fun coming.

Navigate through thrilling levels, jumping over gaps and dodging obstacles. Get ready for an adrenaline rush as you tackle exciting challenges on your way to victory!\n\nHow to Play Crazy Motorcycle\n\nCrazy Motorcycle combines Minecraft graphics with classic 80s arcade gameplay. Your movements are limited to left, right, up, down, and jumping. Simple but all crucial to your survival on this obstacle-ridden bike course. You also have control over the sound being on or off. Ah, the good old days were when choice was more tangible. The lack of frills is no measure of fun in this thrilling bike race in the sky.\n\nThere are four available worlds to play in, with different terrains and obstacles in each of them. In every world, there are 16 stages to complete before getting to the end.\n\nThe object of the game is to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards to fatten your final score. You will mainly be going straight with the occasional moves to the right and left to avoid hitting obstacles or, worse, meeting your fate with the abyss below you by falling off the race track.\n\nYou can't get away with a straight run, and even on level one, you must maneuver to avoid falling to your demise.\n\nThe race course is also not entirely linear, and there are breaks in the course with nothing below you but chance. This is where your jumps will come into play. The wider the gap, the more speed and jump you will need to cross the divide.\n\nIf you see a series of swerving roads ahead with moving obstacles, slow down to retain your balance and avoid getting knocked off the road. The key to moving items is to move with them, even if you get close to the edge. Not all items can be jumped over.\n\nGrab the red flags along the road; they represent checkpoints and allow you to restart from there should you fall, while yellow flags let you collect coins, which you can use to buy new voxelated skins in the menu.\n\nLastly, you can compete against other players by checking your score against theirs in the leaderboard, also available in the main menu.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBuckle up or wear your helmet and check out more of our driving games!

It combines high-speed thrills with a test of precision and timing across 22 adrenaline-filled levels. Each course introduces fresh, intense obstacles from gravity-defying loops to dangerous ramps and explosive traps that keep you on the edge of your seat. Gear up, strap on your helmet, and prepare to perform stunts of a lifetime as you race against the clock.\n\nHow to Play Moto X3M\n\nSit back, hold on tight, and get ready for a thrilling bike ride (with pretty exciting music). Each level of Moto X3M ramps up the thrill with increasingly complex obstacles that require precision, skill, and, above all, patience. Don't get too distracted by the fun; every mistake comes at a price, and that price is time. And time is the key to nailing the coveted 3-star rating, where only the fastest, cleanest runs bring you victory.\n\nMastering each level means finding that sweet spot between speed, braking, and stunt work, all while dodging obstacles designed to slow you down.\n\nMoto X3M offers 22 distinct tracks, each progressively challenging. While the early levels ease you, later tracks become obstacle-filled gauntlets of ramps, loops, and hazards. With each track’s unique layout, there’s plenty of replay value as you strive to beat your best time. The game can get pretty addictive.\n\nAs you conquer each course, you will earn stars and can use them to unlock two new bikes! It’s more than just a visual upgrade; new bikes give you added motivation to return to tracks and push for faster times and higher scores.\n\nMoto X3M features vibrant 2D graphics, fluid physics-based animation, and a playful, slapstick tone. Crashes are humorous, with ragdoll physics and cartoon-style explosions keeping the action lighthearted. Each track has its own theme, from sunny beaches to underground caves, while energetic music and sound effects heighten the thrill of racing and performing stunts.\n\nPush your speed to the max, but don't rush into unknown obstacles without caution. Every fall adds seconds, impacting your star rating. Aim to squeeze in as many air stunts as you can over big jumps to shave precious seconds off your final time!\n\nAdvanced Moves\nFlips & Combos: Chain flips on long jumps to reduce your final time.\nBack Wheel Boost: Landing on your rear wheel at the right angle gives a speed boost.\nTimer Delay Trick: Wait for the perfect moment to start moving and effectively pause the timer.\nHidden Shortcuts: Some levels allow creative routes to bypass obstacles or save time.\nGame Levels\n\nLevels unlock sequentially, growing in difficulty from beginner-friendly ramps to extreme obstacles. Stars earned on each level unlock new bikes, adding visual variety and motivation to replay tracks. Checkpoints prevent frustration, letting you retry tricky sections without restarting the entire level.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nKeep your wheels on the ground for maximum speed when needed, but don’t hesitate to brake approaching tricky obstacles.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many games in the Moto X3M series, like Basketball Legends and Basketball Stars. You can also browse our driving category and try popular titles where you drive fast in Snow Rider 3D. How fast can you go on ice?

Perform daring stunts, collect valuable coins, and tackle tough trials to earn major rewards as you push your skills to the limit. With every twist, turn, and jump, the adventure gets more intense. Buckle up!\n\nHow to Play Offroad Island\n\nYour goal in Offroad Island is to explore the map, gather gold, and complete races. There are three expansive, open-world maps, each offering its own set of challenges and terrains. From the stunt-filled Woodlands to the muddy, dense forests of MuddyHill, every map is uniquely designed to push your off-road skills to the limit. Whether navigating rugged trails, conquering steep hills, or mastering tight corners, these environments will keep you on your toes.\n\nThe game boasts a stunning collection of vehicles, ranging from iconic Cherokees and rugged Hummers to classic hotrods. But that’s just the beginning! You can also purchase quads, SxS vehicles, crawlers, bikes, and even hook-up trailers for your ride. Explore the premium vehicle collection for a selection of custom motors to make your off-road adventure even more thrilling.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your vehicle, the true fun begins with a wide range of customization options.

The in-depth tuning menu lets you fine-tune each component to create the perfect off-road machine suited to your driving style.\n\nThe graphics in Offroad Island are quite realistic, where every terrain comes to life. As you drive, your vehicle’s wheels tear into the dirt, splashing mud and leaving behind a trail of debris that coats your ride. The suspension reacts dynamically to the ever-changing ground beneath you, providing a truly immersive experience. Whether you're conquering rocky hills or drifting through muddy swamps, the varied terrain ensures every ride feels authentic and challenging.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce your Offroad Island journey comes to an end, you can check out some more of our free roaming driving games or car games.

Play with other people from around the world, or with your friends in one of the many challenging yet wacky game modes.\n\nHow to Play Mr. Dude: Online Multiverse Challenge\n\nYou’ll need to wait in each game mode until enough other players are found to join you. You don’t directly interact with them, but you can get inspired by their moves.\n\nChoose your mode:\n\nRandom Map\nColored Floor (Disco Version)\nDangerous Bridge\nEscape (From Hell!)\nPanic Room (Horror Movie Style)\nDisco Mode\n\nIn Disco, a colorful floor awaits, but every few seconds, most of the colors disappear. If you are standing on a tile that is gone, the bouncers will fling you off the dance floor. Collect as many coins as possible while staying on the safe colors.\n\nDangerous Bridge Mode\n\nCross the bridge in various settings: a construction site, a rooftop, or an island with shark-infested waters below. One wrong move and it's game over. Make precise jumps and do not rush until you have built confidence.\n\nHell Mode\n\nStart on a stone slab with molten lava flowing beneath you. Jump across other slabs while avoiding the lava unless you want to stay in hell for eternity.\n\nHorror Movie Mode\n\nThis mode places you in a seemingly normal home, but it is anything but normal. You must find the key to escape. You have 10 seconds to search without anyone chasing you. If you take longer, a villain on a bicycle will start chasing you. If they catch you, it is game over. Interact with objects using the E key.\n\nRandom\n\nThis mode sends you to any one of the games above.\n\nThis multiplayer game is perfect for playing with players worldwide or with friends and family. Want to play with friends? Access private rooms to keep the game among familiar faces.\n\nTip\n\nYou’ll receive a suitcase full of daily rewards. Spin the Wheel of Fortune to see what gift you get. Gifts can include coins, dynamite, shoes with a bit of extra pep, lifelines, and more.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty more games with a similar vibe in our casual collection.

Stand out in battle by customizing your stickman! Choose your character's colors, heads, and weapons to reflect your unique style.\n\nChoose from an arsenal, including boxing gloves, ice cream, boots, daggers, guitars, katanas, bombs, portal guns, and scythes.

Use bombs strategically to clear crowds without harming teammates.\n\nBoss Fights\n\nThese epic battles test your skills.

Teamwork and precision are your best allies here.\n\nGame Tips\n\nStay agile: The more you move, the harder you are to hit.\n\nUse the environment: Maps come with unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nMaster timing: Especially in boss fights, precision and teamwork are key.\n\nExperiment: Try different weapons and strategies to discover what works best for you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere is plenty of action to go around, so browse our vast selection of games to continue playing.

You control a sneaky thief’s hand as it reaches for valuable treasures, but the path is filled with complex traps, laser security systems, and tricky obstacles. Do you have what it takes to outsmart each trap that comes your way?\n\nHow to Play Thief Puzzle\n\nIn Thief Puzzle, you're tasked with a series of sneaky heists in various comical settings. You'll start by testing your skills in simple situations: snatching a purse from an old woman seated on a bench or grabbing groceries from two unsuspecting women from a ledge. As you progress, the challenges escalate. You’ll even swipe a tourist’s suitcase while they admire the Eiffel Tower and outwit a rival thief to steal a money bag in a museum. There’s never a dull moment as you navigate your way through each clever scenario.\n\nFrom beachside schemes where you steal a pearl from a shell to slipping into restricted areas by pickpocketing a key, every level brings new surprises. As the difficulty increases, you’ll find yourself pulling off trickier moves like swiping a diamond ring from a newly engaged couple while they’re lost in a kiss or lifting answers from a classmate’s test without getting caught by whirling fans. You’ll also have to outsmart guard dogs to steal car keys, drive away with precision, avoid TNT explosions, and—just for fun—snatch a toupee from the head of a party guest.\n\nAs the levels progress, you will need increasing sharp thinking and precise timing as you carefully plot your moves to avoid detection and snatch the prize. With every stage growing more challenging, you'll need to outwit elaborate defenses using clever strategies and creative solutions.\n\nSharp thinking alone won't cut it. You will need to calculate the perfect angles and find the shortest path to avoid detection. The puzzles are designed to challenge your wit and timing, requiring you to navigate obstacles and interact with dynamic environments. The slightest misstep could alert your target or trigger traps, so precision is key as you outmaneuver everything from dogs, furniture, and, of course, unsuspecting victims.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant a few more brain-teasing games to get you scratching your head?

Stay alert as other players may try to steal your progress, adding an exciting twist to the challenge. Strategize and race to complete your bridge first in this thrilling test of skill and speed!\n\nHow to Play Bridge Race\n\nBridge Race is an oddly satisfying game where you aim to collect as many blocks of your color as possible and carry them across the board to build a bridge. The objective is to create a path that leads you to the next collection area and, ultimately, to the finish line. Victory is sweet, but the challenge continues as each round gets more difficult.\n\nThe game is designed to be both simple and rewarding, with delicate sounds that create a satisfying atmosphere. You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.\n\nBut you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category title called Blob Opera, a game that uses a machine learning model trained on authentic voices to make it easy for anyone to create amazing operatic music.

You will need to run through a course head-on, filled with obstacles, while collecting as many points as possible. The gamescape is set up like a runway, and obstacles are everywhere. They could be right in front of you, coming from below, dropping from above. Stay vigilant and keep your eye on the prize. You want to make it to the end of the course.\n\nAlong the way, collect green rewards and pink diamonds for significant score boosts, but steer clear of anything red or items that split your points. At the end of the course, you will face a giant skeleton. Aim carefully to hit your target. Experiment to find its Achilles’ heel, sometimes right between the eyes, works for maximum damage to earn extra points. You may not be able to defeat it right away, but each attempt helps you rack up a higher score.\n\nEach round introduces new obstacles, including sliding floors that can help you gather more points if you move skillfully. Be careful of spikes that rise from the ground and bombs that drop from the sky, both of which can cost you the run.\n\nBetween runs, you can buy accessories to customize your character.\n\nTip\n\nAim for the monster's center when you fire your cannonballs at the end of the round.

Complete this training section, and you'll be ready to take the fight online!\n\nChoose your game\n\nThere are four game modes in StarBlast.\n\nThese modes are:\n\nteam mode\nsurvival mode\ninvasion\npro deathmatch.\n\nTeam mode is a good starting point for a new player, as you'll have a crew to back you up. Choose from three primary teams:\n\nFederation\nSovereign Trappist Colonies\nOrion Arm Guild\n\nMine gems\n\nGems are the backbone of the StarBlast economy. You'll find them by mining asteroids and destroying the ships of opposition forces. Shoot rocks until they explode! Ensure you target rocks suitable for your ship's size and power.\n\nUpgrade your ship\n\nYou can buy upgrades with all of those precious gems you've earned. You can also use gems to buy upgrades, and you can convert them into credits to buy additional weapons at your team's base.

There is a serene exhilaration of soaring when you get the hang of the controls, but it doesn't last long. You need to land! Every flight pushes your skills to the limit as you navigate unpredictable terrains and intense weather conditions. Will you make a smooth touchdown or end in a spectacular, fiery crash?\n\nHow to Play Crazy Plane Landing\n\nYour main objective in Crazy Plane Landing is to take flight, avoid obstacles, and land your plane safely. This sounds easy enough, but there is a reason some airline pilots need over a thousand hours of flight time for certification. It isn't easy!\n\nYou’ll need to master both acceleration and steering with simple game gears—hold the left mouse button, space bar, W key, or up arrow to accelerate and gain altitude, giving your plane just enough speed to soar through the skies. As you navigate, use the left mouse button or the left and right arrow keys to steer your plane on course. There are arrows pointing to the destination landing strip. Take your hand off the acceleration and steer towards the landing pad.\n\nPrecision is key—smoothly adjust your trajectory to avoid obstacles and line up your approach for a perfect landing. The right balance between speed and direction will ensure a safe landing. Don't expect too many smooth landings to begin with. This game is called \"crazy\" for a reason.\n\nYou have a few airplanes to choose from but can only upgrade once you've accumulated a significant amount of points. Upgrades are well worth all the crashes that get you accumulated points. You not only get to choose your plane, but you can upgrade engines, boosts, and bonuses.\n\nThe better the plane, the more control you have over your speed and steering.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more driving games to continue the fun. Try Moto X3M, a bike racing game with 22 levels, each of which poses a new challenge and provides the opportunity to perform wild stunts on your dirt bike, or Drift Hunters, a 3D drifting game with an excellent selection of tracks and plenty of tuned-up cars.\n\nRelease Date\nJuly 2021 (Android and iOS)\nMarch 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nMar 27, 2024\n\nControls\nHold the left mouse button / space / W / up arrow to accelerate\nUse the left mouse button / AD / right-left arrow to steer\nFAQ\nIs Crazy Plane Landing realistic?\n\nWhile you don't get a view of sitting behind the pilot's seat, the control you have during take-off and landing is quite a realistic simulation.\n\nCan you do stunts in Crazy Plane Landing?\n\nThere isn't exactly a lot of room for stunts in Crazy Plane Landing, and the aim of the game is essentially to land your airplane safely.\n\nGameplay Video"

Start small with just a handful of planes and airports, then strategically expand by treating travelers to lavish VIP lounges, purchasing state-of-the-art planes, and expanding to international airports. Like most management games, you can't do all the work yourself. Hire skilled managers to automate your flights, upgrade your fleet to maximize efficiency, and ensure top-tier passenger satisfaction. Unlock powerful bonuses and climb the ranks to airline tycoon!\n\nHow to Play Airline Tycoon Idle\n\nYour objective in Idle Airline Tycoon is to transform a small operation into a global airline fleet. Start with a modest amount of airplanes, two to be exact, with limited destinations, but soon you'll be connecting dozens of cities worldwide.\n\nGameplay is simple and made to keep you engaged (and relaxed!) as you click your fleet to take off as often as possible, driving up revenue and unlocking more upgrades. Fly as much as you can, and you will soon find yourself upgrading your airports and planes to gradually grow your airline empire.\n\nPurchasing a new airplane will set you back around $5,000, but it's a crucial step in expanding your airline. To gather the necessary funds, you'll need to fly your planes to the initial routes offered, like Rome, London, and New York, running consistent flights to build up your earnings. The goal is to master these routes and venture into new cities, steadily growing your airline’s reach. Every flight you run brings you closer to unlocking more destinations,\n\nEach choice you make shapes your airline’s success—expand air routes, optimize flight paths, and invest in airport upgrades to attract more passengers and increase your earnings.\n\nThe game combines strategy with the ease of idle gameplay, allowing you to earn profits with a click. But don’t just sit back—efficient management is key.
