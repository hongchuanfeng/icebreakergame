You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun.

There are no shuffles, and the game is timed, but the game's pace is relaxed.\n\nHow to Play Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nSpot the patterns\n\nMahjong is a tricky puzzle game. There are so many tiles, many of which look the same but feature slight differences. Along with the need to spot these patterns, you can’t move any pieces with both sides blocked. The left or right side needs to be accessible, at least.\n\nFinding a couple of “free” tiles is the challenge here, with a tile-free being when there are no tiles on top of it. In addition, either its left or right side needs to be open. In this version of Mahjong Solitaire, you can look at the top of your screen to understand how many pairs of tiles are “free” to be matched, plus you can match the special tiles, those with a colored background, anytime.\n\nUse hints when you’re stuck\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features hints if you get stuck, but unlike some other mahjong games, it does not have a shuffle feature. The games are also timed, meaning there is some urgency to how many tiles you can match.\n\nWhen the game ends, you’ll get a score for the tiles you matched and a bonus for how far you got in the game before your time ran out.\n\nTile groups in Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features 144 tiles divided primarily into three suits. The primary suits are:\n\nDots - feature circles\nBamboo - feature lines\nCharacters - feature Chinese characters\n\nIn Mahjongg Solitaire, you’ll also notice special tiles that can be matched even without the same image. These are highlighted in blue or green.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nMahjong Solitaire is an excellent choice for both beginners and regular Mahjong enthusiasts. However, there are many other titles in our collection of Mahjong games. Other puzzle games you may like include board games such as 2048, Rummikub, and Ludo.\n\nRelease Date\n\nOctober 2016\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile). We also have the Android version.\n\nLast Updated\n\nAug 03, 2022\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact.\n\nFAQ\nIs it spelled mahjong or mahjongg?\nBoth words are correct and are used to describe the same game.\nIs Mahjongg Solitaire a difficult game?\nMahjong is generally a tricky game, but this is probably a medium-difficulty mahjong game compared with others. There are no shuffles, but you have 10 minutes and unlimited hints which balances the game nicely.\nIs Mahjong Solitaire a free game?\n\nYes, you can play Mahjong Solitaire online for free at CrazyGames.\n\nIs Mahjong good for the brain?\n\nPuzzle games are often cited as keeping the mind sharp and maintaining brain health.\n\nGameplay Video"

Each level has its own degree of difficulty.\n\nIf you choose a “green” level, you’ll be met with wider space and angles, making it possible to gain some straight momentum with your arrow. As you choose more difficult levels, you can expect more obstacles, tighter angles and more of them.\n\nSpace Waves allows you to choose any level you want to play, so you can start with the most difficult which can quickly give you a sense of the need for quick reaction times.\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nMove in a zigzag when obstacles are ahead, as this will give you the momentum of a straight line trajectory.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more casual games, check out our Casual category and browse the selection.\n\nSome casual games worth exploring include: Snow Rider 3D, Sand Tetris, World’s Hardest Game and Free GeoGuessr.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 22, 2025\n\nControls\nPC Controls\nHold the left mouse button / W / Spacebar to go up and release to go down.\nP to pause the game\nMobile Controls\n\nHold the screen to go up and release to go down.\n\nGameplay Video"

Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

Drive your go-kart, pick up weapons, and blow up other karts to win! Keep playing to level up and unlock new characters and prizes.\n\nHow to Play Smash Karts\nBattle and earn XP\n\nFace off with other players in the arena for 3 minutes of kart-smashing mayhem. The game features several maps to explore, and it is continually updated with new ones. Each public match you play will give you XP, which you can then use to level up. \n\nLeveling up will reward you with coins, hats, wheels, and character tokens. You can use character tokens in the prize machine to unlock new characters with varying rarity levels.\n\nPick up weapons\n\nDrive over the boxes containing question marks to pick up random weapons and power-ups. You’ll find anything from invincibility to missiles, machine guns, and mines to use against your opponents. Get in your kart and cause some chaos!\n\nAvailable Weapons\n\nRockets: fairly straightforward, helpful for hitting opponents in front of you.\nMachine Gun: it rapidly fires several projectiles and can take down enemies around you, as long as you are close by.\nBullets: with these, you’ll fire a series of bullets that will go straight from your position. It can be useful to fire at enemies in crowded contexts or on long, straight alleys.\nMines: you can deploy three mines that serve as a static trap for your challengers. Mines are particularly effective when placed around corners or hidden behind item boxes.\nCannonballs: using this will send four cannonballs in the direction of your choice. Cannonballs require precision to be effective, but can eliminate multiple adversaries simultaneously.\nSpiky-Go-Round: activating the spiky-go-round will add rotating balls with spikes to your vehicle, which will make any contact with opponents lethal for them.\nNuke: a very powerful missile that has a wide impact radius.\nLobgrenuke: with a lobgrenuke you are placing a TNT-like static bomb on the ground. It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items!

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

However, constant movement can work in your favor: it’s harder to hit a moving target and easier to surprise your opponent with unexpected strikes.\n\nStickman Clash is designed for one or two players, and three- and four-player modes are planned for even more chaotic fun!\n\nSurvival mode\n\nWork together to fend off waves of monsters and defend your base. Use bombs strategically to clear crowds without harming teammates.\n\nBoss Fights\n\nThese epic battles test your skills. The pickaxe-wielding boss is especially challenging, dodge its attacks and counter with well-timed bombs. Teamwork and precision are your best allies here.\n\nGame Tips\n\nStay agile: The more you move, the harder you are to hit.\n\nUse the environment: Maps come with unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nMaster timing: Especially in boss fights, precision and teamwork are key.\n\nExperiment: Try different weapons and strategies to discover what works best for you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere is plenty of action to go around, so browse our vast selection of games to continue playing.

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

They are difficult, but not impossible. Your goal is to reach the finish line, whether you can get through dangerous obstacles or not-so-dangerous ones. Any collision will likely destroy your car. Precision is key to survival, making this game ideal for anyone seeking a thrill.\n\nHow to Play Deadly Descent\n\nPrepare for the most intense, destructive races of your life in Deadly Descent.\n\nYou will be on a dirt road track or similar landscapes with nothing but speed in your control.\n\nMost of the races will leave your car completely destroyed, smashed, flipped, torn apart, catapulted off the edge, or worse. But the key is to get there first. Yes, it may sound odd, but your goal is to be the fastest in the race and survive as best you can with a banged-up car rather than suffer a fatal off-road accident.\n\nKeep your speed steady. Going fast will help you reach the finish line quickly, but it can also generate the force to destroy your car if you lose control.\n\nGive yourself enough time to brake and navigate obstacles such as smashing levers, spiked rolling crushers, sporadic crates, and more. If your car flips, you can survive if it gets banged up, no problem. But if it hits any of these objects at full force, you are likely not going to make it out of the round in one piece.\n\nEach round offers new obstacles to overcome, challenging your reflexes and strategy as you push your car to the limit.\n\nFeatures\nDestructible vehicles\nRefined physics and detailed graphics\nUnique tracks and endless challenges\nThe experience is highly realistic while remaining optimized to run smoothly on both phones and computers.\nMore Games Like This\n\nSatiate your need for speed with a few more driving games from our vast selection. If you want to change vehicles, Moto X3M is one of our most popular. Get back in the car in Drift Hunters, another car game where speeding is nearly required. If you're in the mood for a classic, try Polytrack.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 14, 2025\n\nControls\n\nPC Controls\n\nWASD / arrow keys = control the car\nC = change camera view\n\nMobile Controls\n\nUse the on-screen buttons and on-screen steering wheel to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nCan you drive with a banged up car in Deadly Descent?\n\nYes, you can drive with a banged-up car in Deadly Descent.

You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down. There is a very generous reward system that incentivizes players to keep coming back, and the community in the rooms is constantly rotating, which makes each room a completely new social adventure.\n\nGameplay Video"

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

Put your brain to the test and see how far you get!\n\nHow to Play Bloxorz\n\nUse your arrow keys to move the block correctly through the level and into the hole. The goal sounds simple, but Bloxorz is a challenging brain game that gets trickier and more mind-boggling as you progress. There are 33 levels in total.\n\nAs the levels get tougher, new pieces of the puzzle are added to increase the difficulty. There are switches, special tiles, multiple blocks and various ways in which they are used to add complexity to the puzzle.\n\nWhat are the Different Switches and Tiles?\n\nThere are 3 types of switch in Bloxorz. You have the circle switch that works when you land on it in any fashion, this is also referred to as a “soft” switch. X-shaped switches require you to land upright to activate. The third switch type looks like parentheses () and teleports your block to different locations, splitting it into two smaller blocks in the process.\n\nThere are also orange tiles which are more fragile than regular tiles. These will fall through if you try to stand up vertically on them.\n\nWant Another Logic Challenge?\n\nAs well as being a tricky brain game, Bloxorz is an old-school classic from the Flash gaming era, lovingly restored through Ruffle emulation.

The only way out is to problem-solve your way to freedom by solving riddles using colors, paints, and painting tools that can be found throughout the room. Each clue will lead to the next, until finally, your colorful journey leads you to an exit.\n\nHow to Play Paint Room Escape\n\nIn Paint Room Escape, your objective is to unlock doors by solving color-based puzzles. One of the first tasks is to paint the colorless door using hints scattered throughout the room. Search for items like palettes and pencil holders and get guided into selecting the correct colors. For example, one puzzle requires painting a door with specific color patterns by observing how circles and squares are divided on a palette. As you progress, different combinations of colors help you unlock new areas and doors, with red and yellow paint being crucial early on.\n\nAs you move through the rooms, you will come across more complex puzzles. In one scenario, you must rotate color samples and match a sequence of pale blue to dark blue shades. You'll also encounter digit-based locks, like a door that requires entering a secret code to unlock.\n\nCompleting these challenges rewards you with items such as paint tubes, allowing you to progress by filling in corresponding door sections. New color clues emerge as you rinse objects in water, revealing hidden numbers and hints for further puzzles.\n\nManipulating various tools, such as temperature controls and stencils, adds even more challenging layers of complexity. At one point, you must adjust the temperature to paint the door a certain color, then adjust it once more to switch to another color.\n\nOne of the final challenges involves arranging pencils, rotating objects, and solving shape-based puzzles to activate switches and unlock the exit door. Mixing colors like blue and yellow to create green and using a screwdriver to access hidden compartments are essential steps to achieving your ultimate creative goal—escape by color!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more puzzle game fun?

Use your chess pieces' unique abilities to navigate through each stage and reach the king.\n\nHow to Play Chessformer\nChess piece movements\n\nChessformer utilizes the movement principles of chess pieces to overcome various challenges on a 2D grid. That means rooks move only in straight lines, bishops only move diagonally, etc. The difference is that you're moving sideways, so moving your piece up the board also causes it to fall.\n\nTricky challenges\n\nChessformer gives you an easy introduction to how the game works, with the first few levels being quite simple. However, the difficulty quickly increases. You'll have to get your problem-solving cap on and think creatively to progress through the levels.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nChessformer isn't your typical chess game. If you want to play chess, head to our chess games, where you'll find plenty more. For similar classic puzzle games, check out titles like Classic Solitaire, Mahjongg, Uno Online, and Sudoku.\n\nFeatures\nClever mechanics based on chess pieces\nMovement confined to a chessboard grid\n24 challenging levels put your mind to work\nSatisfying visuals, sounds, and music\nRelease Date\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDeveloper\n\nRobert Alvarez developed this game.\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nSteam\nLast Updated\n\nMar 06, 2023\n\nControls\n\nClick (or touch) on pieces to select, then click to move them.\n\nFAQ\nHow to play Chessformer?\n\nEach piece in Chessformer follows its traditional movement rules: rooks in straight lines, bishops diagonally, and so on. The twist is that you navigate sideways, so moving a piece upward also shifts its position downward on the board.\n\nHow many levels are there in Chessformer?\n\nThere are 48 levels in Chessformer.\n\nGameplay Video",

Your character is a slime that can only move a limited number of times when off the ground. That makes certain moves more challenging, and you’ll have to plan ahead to figure out how to complete each task.\n\nLearn how to Growmi\n\nOnce you overcome the initial difficulty of thinking like a Growmi, it does get easier. If you get stuck, use the hints button in the bottom right corner to show you how to complete the challenge correctly. Once you see how it works, your skills will definitely improve.\n\nFix your mistakes\n\nEvery new area has a unique challenge to keep you on your toes, and it keeps the game engaging for you. Sometimes, you might need to restart the challenge by clicking R, or undo a previous move with U. That’s because some actions can’t be fixed without taking a step back!\n\nProgress through the game to unlock more abilities and a longer Growmi!\n\nMore puzzles to play\n\nIf you enjoy a stimulating brain-busting challenge, check out more of our puzzle games.

Search for clues around the room and look for clues that help you reach your goal of escaping.\n\nEscape Room Games\n\nDo you love a challenge? Escape rooms are great for logical, puzzle-solvers. You'll find plenty of them in our Escape Games collection. Many escape room games feature an element of horror, like House of Celestina.

Collect resources to gain experience points (XP) and level up your ship. Each level unlocks new ships and modules—offering unique abilities like mining, attacking, or boosting speed. To equip a module, simply drag it from your inventory into one of your ship’s module slots. Customizing your ship’s loadout allows you to adapt to different strategies and playstyles.\n\nTo climb the leaderboard, you’ll need to build and protect your base. Use the toolbar at the bottom of the screen to access different building types, each with its own cost and function. Make sure you’ve mined enough resources before constructing anything, then drag and drop buildings onto the map grid.\n\nDynamo: The heart of your base, powering nearby tiles when fueled. Click it or drag a resource to it to supply power.\nScorer: Generates leaderboard points over time, but only when powered by a nearby Dynamo.\nTurrets: Automatically defend your base against enemies, but require power to function.\nWalls: Strong, low-cost defenses ideal for protecting your core structures.\n\nStay alert! Other players can attack your base at any time! If your ship is destroyed, you’ll lose everything: your modules, inventory, and progress. On the flip side, defeating other players earns you valuable XP.\n\nStrategy Tips\nFocus on leveling up your ship first before building a base. A stronger ship makes resource collection faster and safer.\nExperiment with modules. You can freely swap them out to match your current objectives.\nUse the edges of the map as natural defenses for your base, but keep in mind that resources are scarcer there.\n\nMaster resource management, smart base-building, and tactical ship upgrades to become the top pilot in Voxorp!\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 28, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = move around\nHold the left mouse button on resources = mine resources\nDrag the left mouse button = drag modules from your inventory into your ship"

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects. Atom Bombs cause localized destruction, Hydrogen Bombs hit larger areas, and MIRVs split to hit multiple points, affecting only the player you targeted.\n\nInteracting with other players is simple:\n\nChat messages and emojis let you communicate quickly\nTarget markers help coordinate attacks with allies\nAlliance requests grow your network of support\n\nTips\n\nAlways try to help allies with troops or gold to strengthen relationships. Focusing on building relationships in Front Wars is key to winning.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out our .io category for more battle games like this one.

Each level has its own degree of difficulty.\n\nIf you choose a “green” level, you’ll be met with wider space and angles, making it possible to gain some straight momentum with your arrow. As you choose more difficult levels, you can expect more obstacles, tighter angles and more of them.\n\nSpace Waves allows you to choose any level you want to play, so you can start with the most difficult which can quickly give you a sense of the need for quick reaction times.\n\nTips and Tricks\n\nMove in a zigzag when obstacles are ahead, as this will give you the momentum of a straight line trajectory.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more casual games, check out our Casual category and browse the selection.\n\nSome casual games worth exploring include: Snow Rider 3D, Sand Tetris, World’s Hardest Game and Free GeoGuessr.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 22, 2025\n\nControls\nPC Controls\nHold the left mouse button / W / Spacebar to go up and release to go down.\nP to pause the game\nMobile Controls\n\nHold the screen to go up and release to go down.\n\nGameplay Video"

Drive your go-kart, pick up weapons, and blow up other karts to win! Keep playing to level up and unlock new characters and prizes.\n\nHow to Play Smash Karts\nBattle and earn XP\n\nFace off with other players in the arena for 3 minutes of kart-smashing mayhem. The game features several maps to explore, and it is continually updated with new ones. Each public match you play will give you XP, which you can then use to level up. \n\nLeveling up will reward you with coins, hats, wheels, and character tokens. You can use character tokens in the prize machine to unlock new characters with varying rarity levels.\n\nPick up weapons\n\nDrive over the boxes containing question marks to pick up random weapons and power-ups. You’ll find anything from invincibility to missiles, machine guns, and mines to use against your opponents. Get in your kart and cause some chaos!\n\nAvailable Weapons\n\nRockets: fairly straightforward, helpful for hitting opponents in front of you.\nMachine Gun: it rapidly fires several projectiles and can take down enemies around you, as long as you are close by.\nBullets: with these, you’ll fire a series of bullets that will go straight from your position. It can be useful to fire at enemies in crowded contexts or on long, straight alleys.\nMines: you can deploy three mines that serve as a static trap for your challengers. Mines are particularly effective when placed around corners or hidden behind item boxes.\nCannonballs: using this will send four cannonballs in the direction of your choice. Cannonballs require precision to be effective, but can eliminate multiple adversaries simultaneously.\nSpiky-Go-Round: activating the spiky-go-round will add rotating balls with spikes to your vehicle, which will make any contact with opponents lethal for them.\nNuke: a very powerful missile that has a wide impact radius.\nLobgrenuke: with a lobgrenuke you are placing a TNT-like static bomb on the ground. It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items! Use your coins, character tokens, and gems to buy various in-game items.\n\nPlay in events\n\nVarious seasonal events occur throughout the year, so make sure to come back and play Smash Karts at special times of year for new content.

Explore the underwater world and its legendary fish to unlock a variety of unique characters. Your goal is to become the most excellent fisher on the planet. Get ready for surprises in every layer of the deep, as they get bigger and bigger.\n\nHow to Play Fish Orbit\n\nFish Orbit is a fast-paced fishing game where each cast takes you deeper into the ocean. Drop your line, reel in exotic catches, and unlock new characters as you work toward becoming the ultimate fisher. Every layer of the sea holds surprises, from schools of small fish to rare creatures hidden in the depths.\n\nYour goal is to cast your line as far and deep as possible. Timing is crucial. Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

(Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it.

Flying knives are generally a no-no, but in this game, they are the only way to progress to new blades and skins.\n\nSlice Master reviewed\n\nWe really enjoyed the fun tactile slicing of this game. The sounds are just perfect. I liked how the kids had to work out which mathematical operator was the best to go for at the end of the level - \"is x4 better than +60?\" Also, because you play it with just one button, it was a game that the whole family could have a go at, even from the youngest of us. In fact, our grandparents also got involved and turned out to be pretty competitive.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase\n\nHow to Play Slice Master\n\nSlice Master is a one-button game controlled by the space pad on your keyboard or the left click on your mouse. All the control lies in this one simple movement. The game has an ASMR quality, and the consistent slicing is oddly soothing to the ear.\n\nThe aim is simple: slice everything in sight: fruit, shapes, walls, furniture, and more. You can slice most things, but don’t add the white wall to your target list—it’s just a holding material for your knife.\n\nYou will get to shop along the way, using the coins accumulated to unlock sharper blades, swords, maces, and more: anything to help you slice even more!\n\nTips\nStay away from the pink spiked metal shapes. They are too strong for your knife and will take you straight back to the beginning of the round. Sometimes these can be found at the bottom of a pile of objects to slice, so be careful to lift your knife in time to avoid them\nHit the correct numeric target at the end of each level to multiply your points by the target number and boost your score.\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf casual games are your style, you can find a slew of them in our casual game category. Go for a classic like Bubble Shooter Classic or a head-scratching word teaser like Word Search.\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 31, 2024\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button or space to flip your knife into action.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I earn more points in Slice Masters?\n\nWhen you reach the end of the level, make sure you hit the numbered targets to multiply your points. The higher the number, the more points you will receive, so aim high.\n\nCan I cut the white pillar in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, the white pillar can’t be cut, but you can attach it and use it as a safety net to prevent it from hitting the ground.\n\nCan I go backwards in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, you can only go forward in Slice Masters.\n\nHow many knives can I unlock in Slice Masters?\n\nYou can unlock 9 knives in Slice Masters so keep those points coming.\n\nGameplay Video",

You control one of these weapon-wielding eggs in one of four online game modes where the aim is to shatter your opponents with bullets and bombs. It's the ultimate online egg shooting game!\n\nKids love games where they shoot other players. Whatever you think about guns this seems to always be the case. We let our children play Shell Shockers before the older rating games with guns because it's a less violent way to have fun online. In fact, they enjoyed it so much that even though they are older they still go back to play this again and again.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Shell Shockers\n\nJump into the game and select your character name, customize your egg,  and choose one of four game modes. In this game, you must work hard to protect yourself and dish out damage to opposing eggs. Try out each game mode and see if you can conquer the Shell Shockers arena. \n\nTips and tricks\nPlay tactically\nAct quickly\nCollect egg ammunition\nThink like an egg\nGame modes\nTeams\n\nJoin a team (either red or blue) and fight against the enemy eggs until your team has the most kills collectively.\n\nFree For All\n\nEvery egg for themselves. If you see an egg, you shoot. Unless you want to be scrambled yourself. There is only one winner in this mode.\n\nCaptula the Spatula\n\nTwo teams battle for control of the spatula. The team with the spatula earns points for kills, but these can be lost if the player holding the spatula dies.\n\nKing of the Coop\n\nKing of the Coop was added in December 2021 with a host of cosmetic items and a new map. Two teams battle to capture a defined area known as the coop. The players on the winning team get 250 golden eggs each!\n\nWeapons\n\nThere are seven main weapon types in Shell Shockers. Each weapon has its advantages and drawbacks. If you have eggcellent aim, a weapon like the Crackshot would be great. If you’re more of a spray-and-pray type, try out the Whipper. The complete weapon list for Shell Shockers is:\n\nEggK-47 - classic medium-range automatic\nScrambler - high-damage shotgun\nFree Ranger - semi-automatic sniper rifle\nRPEGG - huge damage RPG\nWhipper - close to medium range rapid-fire rifle\nCrackshot - bolt-action sniper rifle\nTriHard - accurate medium-range burst-fire rifle\n\nAdditionally, each player has an additional gun and can pick up grenades from the map.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe game uses Golden Eggs as currency; you can use them to upgrade the way your character appears in the game or the weapons it uses. Mind you, using the Golden Eggs in the shop won’t allow you to buy items that give you an advantage during combat.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more online shooting games, check out our multiplayer io games and browse the selection, which includes the highly popular Agar io.\n\nIf you are looking for something totally different, consider trying Bubble Shooter or 2048.\n\nFeatures\nFast-paced FPS gameplay\nA unique theme centered around eggs\nVarious weapons and game modes \nEgg customization and a shop for more items\nDeveloper\n\nShell Shockers is developed by Blue Wizard Digital (formerly known as the Egg and Dairy Ministry of Belarus).

You race a car you've customized, on a track you might have designed yourself. This is a fast-paced, low-poly driving game featuring thrilling loops, jumps, and high-speed action where every millisecond counts.\n\nInspired by TrackMania, it challenges you to race against the clock, constantly striving to improve your time on various tracks built by you and the Polytrack community! It doesn't get any more hands-on than that.\n\nHow to Play Polytrack\n\nYou can race on the racecourses you've designed, but it's probably easier to start with the existing ones. You not only have to think about beating your own record when it comes to time, but you also need to master the craft of building for speed and precision.\n\nStart by creating your track using the game’s design tools or choosing from pre-made tracks. Customize the track with various obstacles, ramps, and curves to suit your preferences. Don't know exactly what track to build? Get help from the Polytrack community. There are plenty of forums that share design codes and customization tips.\n\nWith a built-in level editor, you can unleash your creativity by designing custom tracks. You can also export and share these tracks with others for endless racing (and design) fun.\n\nThe game will require time and patience, as you don't just go into it like other driving games, with your foot on the pedal and ready to rev and drift. Initially, the easiest tracks to build are straight lines, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you will have a track jumping over mountains, sending your car and score soaring.\n\nYou can also customize your vehicle by choosing a primary and secondary color, as well as the color of the car frame and rims.\n\nA series of premade tracks is available for those who want to begin practicing and getting a feel for other designs.\n\nPolyTrack Unique Features\n\nWhen selecting a track, you can see the best lap times recorded by verified players on it and measure yourself against them.\n\nOne cool feature that differentiates PolyTrack from other driving games is the opportunity to challenge opponents asynchronously, by selecting them from the leaderboard before starting the game, and seeing them as “ghosts” as you race the track. You can also challenge yourself by shaving off some decimals from your best time and then have your car “ghosted” on the track.\n\nAvailable Tracks\n\nThere are currently 15 Official tracks and 22 Community-made tracks:\n\nOfficial tracks:\n\n7 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n4 desert tracks\n\nCommunity tracks:\n\n9 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n9 desert tracks\n\nThe driving experience remains unaltered, independent of the track season: what changes is the scenery surrounding the track.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce you've mastered building your tracks, you can enjoy these other thrilling driving games: Moto X3M, where you experience high-octane motocross action with challenging courses, stunts, and exciting levels, or Drift Hunters, where you test your drifting skills in this game that features a variety of cars and tracks designed for perfecting those thrilling drifts.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 2023\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 17, 2025\n\nControls\nDriving Controls\nWASD / arrow keys = drive\nEnter / R = restart\nEditor Controls\nLeft-click = build\nRight-click + move = move camera view\nMiddle mouse-click + move = rotate camera view\nMouse-scroll = zoom in / out\nShift + mouse-scroll / ZC = height up / down\nQE = rotate camera view to the left / right\nR / Space = rotate item\nX = delete item\nT = test drive\nFAQ\nHow to play Polytrack?\n\nIn Polytrack, you race a car you customize on a track you've designed yourself.

You can challenge the CPU or play with a friend.\n\nThere are two teams, each consisting of two players. Controls guide both your players, but be warned that their actions may not coincide with exactly how you expected them to move. Slam dunks are still very possible!\n\nUse the W key to control player one and the up arrow to control player two. Fight frantically over the basketball, bouncing and spinning in the air, trying to make the shot. Whatever team scores first wins that round. The first team to reach 5 wins the game!\n\nAfter each basket, you’re transported to a new place where the court and the surroundings have changed, and physics and attire may differ, shaking up each new round with random changes!

        "detail": "Games»Casual»Speed»Snow Rider 3D\nSnow Rider 3D\nShare\nRating\n9.0\n(9,832 votes)\nReleased\nApril 2025\nLast Updated\nApril 2025\nTechnology\nHTML5 (Unity WebGL)\nPlatform\nBrowser (desktop-only)\n\nCasual\n\n1,260\n\nAvoid\n\n284\n\n3D\n\n1,243\n\nChristmas\n\n28\n\nPhysics\n\n349\n\nSkill\n\n248\n\nCollect\n\n545\n\nSpeed\n\n148\n\nSnow Rider 3D is a thrilling sled-driving casual game that delivers heart-pounding downhill action and endless winter fun. Dodge obstacles, collect gifts, and race your way through snowy slopes at high speed.\n\nHow to Play Snow Rider 3D\n\nEver wonder what it’s like to be a young Santa learning how to master the sleigh? Snow Rider 3D brings you close to that experience. You’ll find yourself speeding through snowy forests, dodging snowmen, rocky snowcaps, and other tricky obstacles: this is not exactly the easiest place to sled, but that's what makes a true pro.\n\nThe main goal is simple: don’t crash. Hitting any obstacle will shatter your sled and end your run. If you wipe out, you’ll have the option to watch an ad for a second chance, or you can start fresh, often facing a new set of challenges.\n\nYou’re scored based on your Score, Best, and Gifts collected along the way. Use smooth left and right movements to dodge obstacles, and be ready to jump over anything too large to slide past. Openings can be narrow, and timing your jumps is crucial, especially with sudden, steep drops that demand quick reflexes.\n\nGifts are scattered along your path, and collecting them will boost your score, but be warned, they're often placed dangerously close to obstacles. Only go for them if you’re confident you can grab them safely!\n\nHow to Win Snow Rider 3D\n\nIf you want to get a high score in Snow Rider 3D, focus on staying near the center of the slope to give yourself room to maneuver around obstacles. Try to make subtle moves, rather than sudden moves, as there are obstacles everywhere, and not that much space to avoid them. You should also aim to get as many gifts as possible, but the key is to know when to let them pass you by. Snow and steady wins the race in Snow Rider 3D.\n\nA few key factors lead to success:\n\nScore: Your score increases primarily with distance traveled, with some bonus points coming from gifts or performing jumps.\nGifts: The more gifts you collect, the more currency you have. This gives you the power to unlock new sleds.\nSnow Rider 3D Gamescape\n\nSnow Rider 3D is set in a winter landscape with bright white slopes and festive details, all from a first-person view with a view of the tip of a sled to guide you. The clean visuals and holiday accents give it a cozy holiday feel.\n\nBut perhaps one of the best parts of Snow Rider 3D is the sound design. You’ll hear festive sleigh bells at the start, but as you pick up speed, the sounds blur into the sound of your sled whooshing and snow crunching beneath you. In short, it's a winter wonderland.\n\nUpgrades\n\nProgression in Snow Rider 3D is limited to unlocking new sled designs with gifts. There are no power-ups or stat-based upgrades. With over 10 sleighs available, these unlocks provide benchmarks to strive towards.\n\nSnow Rider Levels\n\nThere are no levels per se in Snow Rider 3D as it is an endless loop of slope, curves, bridges, and obstacles.\n\nTips & Tricks\nLearn from your past crashes. You will only get better if you refine your reflexes and sled positioning.\nListen to audio cues like rolling snowballs, wind, or jingles. These are signals for what's to come and can help you plan your next move.\nMore Games Like This\n\nFeeling a need for speed?

Get ready to leave your mark on the asphalt, literally!\n\nHow to Play Drift Hunters\n\nYou start Drift Hunters by selecting your car and the type of ride you want to take. You can upgrade the performance, including the brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine, with superior parts. You can also finish off your car in any color and enjoy a selection of rims on the house.\n\nThe key to this game is scoring points by drifting your car. The more you drift, the more points you get, which you can then spend in the garage to fine-tune your car.\n\nRace Tracks: Drift through diverse circuits like Nishuri, Stadium, Tyshen, and more. Each track offers a unique layout with varied curves and turns, challenging your drifting skills to the max.\n\nCars: Rack up at least 8,500 points to start unlocking cars, with the top model costing over 134k points. Every drift and upgrade gets you closer to that dream ride! If you are a beginner, you might find that it is better to focus on optimizing the performance of entry-level cars before investing all your cash on a new ride.\n\nDrift Hunters available cars:\n\nBMW M3\nToyota Supra\nHonda S2000\nFord Fiesta ST\nNissan 370Z coupe\nDodge Challenger Hellcat\nNissan GTR\nPorsche 911 GT\nAnd 18 more cars...\n\nParts & Upgrades: Customize your vehicle’s performance with upgrades to brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine.\n\nTuning: Adjust your car’s fine-tuning settings, including front and rear camber, offset, brake balance, height, and brake pressure, to perfect your drift style even without additional upgrades.\n\nVisuals: Express your style by customizing the color of your car’s body and rims, and select from a range of rim designs to complete your look.\n\nEvery car you buy can be fully tuned: turbo, brakes, engine, gearbox and weight can range from \"street\" level, the lowest, to the \"pro\", which is also the most expensive. You can fully modify these values to find the best tuning for your drift performance.\n\nSome tracks allow you to keep drifting much more easily than others. The best tracks for drifting in Drift Hunters are Emashi and Forest because of their long corners and lack of too many sharp turns. The Forest track features the longest corners, allowing for the most prolonged drifts.\n\nThe longer you drift, the more your points multiplier increases. You can use the points to buy exotic motors like the high-performance Porsche 911 GT. There are 26 fully customizable cars available to buy in total. \n\nDrift Hunters has a smooth arcade-racer feel but isn’t constrained to a racing format. Instead, you can blaze your own trail in several locations, racking up points to buy new cars and upgrades. The graphics are great for the web, but you can play the game on low-spec devices without a hiccup. It’s a must-play for drift enthusiasts!\n\nTips\nUse acceleration cautiously when approaching corners mid-drift\nDrift from side to side on straight roads to keep the drift alive\nTune up your vehicles to find the sweet spot for maximum drift\nDrive on maps with plenty of space for long, uninterrupted drifting\nMore Games Like This\n\nDriving games are super addictive when they're as good as Drift Hunters.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun.

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

Embark on an epic journey through this magical world, brimming with perilous encounters and thrilling adventures at every turn. Traverse through the looking glass into a realm of enigmatic puzzles and terrifying foes. Unravel the mysteries, aid mythical beings, vanquish villains, and safeguard the universe of Mirrorland. With stunning visuals, an immersive storyline, diverse hero selection, and engaging multiplayer features, prepare for an unforgettable quest where bravery and cunning are your greatest weapons.\n\nHow to Play Mirrorland\n\nFirst things first. To play Mirrorland, you will need to create an online account and select your character (and sidekick). The adventure begins as you ride on horseback along a mysterious, winding path. Your first challenge awaits when the Cheshire Cat, a mischievous yet endearing creature, falls into a hole. Demonstrate your courage and compassion by rescuing him, and in return, he will pledge his unwavering loyalty, becoming your trusted companion and guide throughout the game (sidekick!).\n\nAs you ride further into Mirrorland, the landscape comes alive with the promise of riches. Treasure chests brimming with rewards, glittering gold, and radiant crystals are scattered across your path, waiting to be claimed. Cheshire often spots these hidden troves, so listen to him so you won't miss an opportunity to increase your bounty.\n\nThe road is far from quiet—and cries for help are common. You will need to respond to these pleas to form allies. Battle goblins to protect defenseless victims, shield the White Rabbit as he flees from ominous pursuers, and deliver urgent messages to reunite estranged brothers. Each act of bravery and kindness enriches your story, offering rewards that strengthen your resolve and resources.\n\nThe gameplay is a captivating mix of strategy and direction. Carefully follow the prompts to guide your decisions and immerse yourself in the unfolding narrative. When combat arises, engage in intuitive battles by dragging and dropping attacks to strike down foes. Victory requires precision and skill as you navigate these skirmishes. Beyond the thrill of battle, gather gold, hoard crystals, and complete quests to uncover the deeper layers of Mirrorland’s magic. With every step, your character evolves, and the enchanting world around you reveals its secrets.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe adventure doesn’t have to stop here. Continue playing adventure games.

Create your team from over 50 unique heroes, each inspired by iconic characters you know and love. Dive into intense real-time PvP battles where your skills and tactics are put to the ultimate test. Join forces with fellow guild players to take on epic quests across breathtaking locations, from ancient ruins to mystical landscapes. As you progress, you can upgrade your heroes and gear, enhancing their abilities and unlocking new powers.\n\nHow to Play Battle Arena\n\nIn a world overrun by demons, you must choose a region at a time to combat your opponent. Battle Arena fights start off in Serenity Valley, where you can assess your enemy's squad in just a tap. You get to select your heroes for battle. You begin with only three heroes to play with, each with a different weapon and skill. But the amount of heroes you can eventually upgrade to is countless.\n\nEarly in the game, you will fight Dark Lord, who is less than happy to see you. To win the initial battle and every one afterward, you must use your hero's unique skills—some wield swords while others shoot arrows. Just tap on their avatars at the bottom of the screen to strengthen your attacks.\n\nIn Battle Arena, your objective is pretty much to build and upgrade your heroes and compete in various challenges, particularly in the arena. The gameplay revolves around gathering resources and gaining experience points to level up. Players can participate in raids to acquire new heroes and enhance their existing ones. The key to success in this game is to strategize by selecting the right battle heroes to maximize team effectiveness.\n\nAs you engage in battles, you must use different abilities and relics, which provide unique advantages during combat. Upgrading heroes is crucial to improve your performance in battles.\n\nAlways pay attention to your heroes' health and manage resources wisely, especially during expeditions and arena fights. Using a mix of heroes with complementary skills can lead to successful team combinations and help defeat stronger opponents.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to push through the ranks in the arena by strategizing hero placements and leveraging their abilities effectively. You can earn significant rewards as you progress, which can be reinvested into your hero roster.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore a wide array of adventure games at your fingertips!

Cultivate crops, expand your business, and manage a skilled team. Explore untamed areas, unravel intriguing mysteries, and connect with the charming residents of Woodburn as you build your agricultural empire from the ground up.\n\nHow to Play Country Life Meadows\n\nWelcome to your new farm! You’ve just acquired Roadside Farm, or whatever name you choose, and it’s time to embrace farm life. But first, here’s a letter from the previous owner that will give you an idea of your situation:\n\nHi,\n\nCongrats on buying my farm! Sorry to hear you got stranded overnight - wish I could’ve helped fix your car. I don’t remember that rock being on the road… strange. Anyway, I asked around for help, and hopefully, you’ll find an oil pan soon.\n\nYou were right about the sunrises - they're stunning, much better than in the city! The soil here is top-notch too. Too bad I had to leave in such a rush. Life happens...\n\nThis land is the best spot on that flat hilltop, right near the road. It’s called Roadside Farm, but feel free to rename it. Oh, and please take care of Clarabella!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJim Grey\n\nNow that you’re settling in, it’s time to start farming. Each day brings new rewards, so be sure to check in and claim them. The key to a thriving farm is planting, harvesting, and managing your resources wisely. Sow your seeds, take care of your animals, and keep an eye on your barn and warehouse to track what you’ve gathered. As you grow your farm, you’ll have the chance to expand your land, unlocking even more opportunities to cultivate crops and raise livestock.\n\nClover is an essential crop for your animals. Cows, turkeys, and goats love it, and if you have bees, they’ll pollinate it, producing honey before harvest. Clover is also used in the production of milk, black feathers, and white feathers. Wheat is another staple: grind it at the Dutch Mill to make flour or use it to feed your sheep. It’s a key ingredient in making flour, vodka, wool, and black wool. If you need milk, make sure to feed your Holstein cows. A full cow is a happy cow, and happy cows keep your farm running smoothly.\n\nYour farm has several important buildings to manage. The Dutch Mill turns wheat into flour, and keeping it filled will power the windmill. The barn stores essentials like wheat, clover, and flour, while the warehouse holds resources such as honey, sugar, oxygen, and propane. As you progress, you’ll gain access to even more supplies, including gear, decorations, chests, and medals. Keep an eye on your stockpile to prepare for the next task.\n\nWhile ripe crops are beautiful to look at, don’t forget to harvest and replant to keep your farm productive. Wheat should always be replenished, and replanting clover on eight plots of soil will ensure a steady supply. Adding sacks of wheat to the Dutch Mill will keep your flour production running smoothly. The more you maintain your farm, the more opportunities you’ll unlock, allowing you to expand even further. Check the map to see just how vast your farm can become.\n\nBeyond the daily farm routine, there are plenty of ways to engage with the world around you. If you enjoy a relaxed farming experience, you’ll love the peaceful rhythm of planting and harvesting, accompanied by soothing animations and calming sounds. For those who like a challenge, competitions, achievements, horse racing, and leaderboards offer ways to test your skills and earn permanent prizes. The farming co-op lets you collaborate with fellow players, whether by sending Wedding Doves to ceremonies or trading produce at the Market.\n\nNeighbors are a valuable part of farm life. The more neighbors you have, the more gifts you’ll receive, helping you progress faster. You can also personalize your farm with beautiful artwork and decorations, customizing both your Farmhouse and Log Cabin. If you feel like exploring, venture into the surrounding landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots, or head to the mines to uncover valuable ores and hidden riches.\n\nWith so much to do, you can play Country Life Meadows your way. Relax and unwind with hours of farming fun, compete to showcase your skills, or grow your farm into a flourishing empire. The possibilities are endless: so start planting and watch your farm come to life!\n\nFeatures\nPlay to Relax: Unwind with hundreds of hours of farming fun. Revel in the soothing daily routine of planting and harvesting your crops, complete with beautiful animations and calming sounds.\nPlay to Compete: Test your skills in Competitions, Achievements, Horse Racing, and Leaderboards. Earn permanent prizes, and rewards, and showcase your public stats.\nFarming Co-op: Collaborate with fellow players to achieve common goals. From sending Wedding Doves to weddings to participating in the all-new Market where you can exchange produce with others, teamwork is key.\nNeighborly Gifts: Your Neighbors can send you valuable gifts, so the more neighbors, the faster you’ll progress.\nArtwork: We focus on crafting beautiful in-game artwork rather than promotional materials, so what you see is what you get.\nInterior Decoration: Personalize the interior of your Farmhouse and your Log Cabin in the woods.\nExploration: Venture into vast, picturesque landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots.\nMining: Delve into the depths of The Mines to discover ores and riches.\nBarn Management: Our Barn management offers unparalleled control with filtering options that help you maximize your results.\nMore Games Like This\n\nFinished playing and looking for more?

Build magnificent cities, develop resources, and create a unique culture while engaging in trade and diplomacy. Expand your influence, make historic discoveries, and craft wonders that will be remembered for centuries. Your choices shape the future of your empire: lead wisely!\n\nHow to Play Empire City\n\nEmpire City is a classic management game set in ancient times where you get to build an entire city, including roadways, residential homes, waterways, workshops, and more -- all from a blank slate with a bit of help from two close advisors: Julia and Flavius.\n\nThe game starts with a full intro from Julia and Flavius, which will walk you through step by step how to build your city. Once you have the hang of it, you're on your own. But not to worry, help from your advisors is just a click away.\n\nJulia and Flavius guide you through the following directions:\n\nJulia: \"Welcome to the city, Prefect! I’m Julia. I run an inn here, and I know everything about everyone. This is Flavius, the architect.\"\n\nFlavius: \"My projects can do the talking for me! The first one is a residential building. Let’s get to work!\"\n\nJulia: \"Remember, every building in the city must be connected to a road.\"\n\nAction: You get to build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"Congratulations, Prefect! The building is ready. We can house people in it now.\"\n\nJulia: \"People?! There’s barely room for one citizen. The building needs to be upgraded.\"\n\nAction: Build a house.\n\nFlavius: \"Prefect, we have a problem. We need clay to make the house more spacious, but it’s mined outside the city.\"\n\nJulia: \"If it’s even mined at all! The clay quarry is in bad shape, and the tool storage is totally dilapidated. But our Prefect can solve that, right?\"\n\nAction: Fix the clay quarry.\n\nJulia: \"Now we can hire a manager! But that can happen later. First, we need to build a road to deliver the clay to the city.\"\n\nAction: Build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"The road is wonderful, Prefect! Collect the mined clay, and my people will deliver it to the construction site right away.\"\n\nAction: Collect the clay.\n\nFlavius: \"Thank you for the help. I’ll get to work upgrading the house right now!\"\n\nJulia: \"You and Flavius are doing wonderfully! Let’s upgrade another house. It could use a second floor, with a good view of the city.\"\n\nFlavius: \"Regular clay isn’t enough to build another floor. This requires a sturdier material, such as clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Alas, this material isn’t produced in our city. Although the Prefect could give orders to build a special workshop.\"\n\nJulia: \"If you don’t want to wait, use gems! Their shine speeds up any project. The first time is free, though.\"\n\nAction: Use gems.\n\nFlavius: \"Very grand, Prefect. Now we won’t lack building materials. Give the order to produce clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Production can take a long time. When it ends, a clay mixture icon will appear above the workshop.\"\n\nAction: Wait for production to finish.\n\nFlavius: \"It’s ready, Prefect! Tap the icon to move the mixture to the warehouse.\"\n\nAction: Move the mixture to the warehouse.\n\nJulia: \"So, are we going to upgrade the house or just pretend that it’s intentionally unfinished?\"\n\nFlavius: \"Please accept this scroll. I sketched out some improvements. Remember, Prefect, Julia and I are always here to support you!\"\n\nYou're on your own after this training. Continue building your empire and make Julia and Flavius proud, Prefect!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are in Empire City, you may like more games within our casual game category, so go ahead and have a look!

Your main task is strategically dominating the battlefield to constantly upgrade your army and conquer enemies in an epic 1v1 battle. Lead your army to victory in this strategic game and show your earned skills to the modern world.\n\nThe old Flash game from 2007, Age of War, by Max Game Studios, has clearly been a source of inspiration for Age of Tanks Warriors.\n\nHow to Play Age of Tanks Warriors: TD War\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors is a one-click battle game, so the actual combat portion of the game is fairly simple. The difficulty lies in devising a strategy for utilizing your army and weapons to eliminate your opponents before they can eliminate you and destroy your fortress. Once you do this, you get to upgrade your army and weapons for an even more effective strategy.\n\nThe game begins with your stone cave, which is directly opposite your opponent's cave. You can deploy your soldiers by clicking the small icon on the bottom right of your screen. The only hitch is that you may not have enough soldiers to send out in time to match your opponent's troops!\n\nYour task on each level is to defeat the opposing army and destroy their shelter. As the levels advance, so do the fortresses, making it even more difficult throughout the ages. Fighting begins with sticks and stones, but eventually turns into tanks and artillery.\n\nTips\n\nCollect as many coins and as much food as possible by watching some of the ads. This will help strengthen your troop. Otherwise, it's a bit difficult, as the opponent starts with an advantage.\n\nDon't deploy too many troops straight away. It's best to deploy when the enemy is closer to home territory.\n\nYou can defeat multiple enemies with one of your soldiers, so be skillful in how many you send out simultaneously and which ones.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of battle games, browse our vast selection of popular titles.\n\nAdditional titles that require strategic thinking include Bubble Shooter and 2048.\n\nRelease Date\nFebruary 2024 (Android)\nApril 2024 (iOS)\nApril 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\nLast Updated\n\nJun 10, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact with the game UI.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the age of war military game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War game is an action tower defense battle game in which you fight your opponent to death throughout the ages.\n\nIs Age of Tanks Warriors a good game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War is one of the more popular action titles.

With danger around every corner, your aim is to keep calm and survive the end of the zombie apocalypse.\n\nHow to Play Dead Land: Survival\n\nSet out on a treacherous quest through the desolate lands of Dead Land: Survival, where the world has fallen to ruin, and the infected ones lurk around every corner.

With the help of your assistant, Agatha, and a cast of brilliant engineers like the self-taught Ida, you’ll bring your creative vision of progress to life while balancing the city’s needs and resources.\n\nHow to Play Steam City\n\nYour journey begins with a warm welcome from Agatha, who will guide you through the essentials of city planning. Start by meeting key figures like Ida, a resourceful engineer who quickly points out that the builders already need your support. As mayor, you will complete the exciting task of building the city’s housing. Head to the construction workshop, select your first house and drag it onto the map. Every building requires a road for access, so plan strategically. From modest homes to grand residences, you will be able to design spacious, comfortable houses that cater to a growing population.\n\nResources are the lifeblood of your city’s development. Start by extracting natural resources like sand to produce essential building materials in your factories. When the sand runs out, you must activate the nearby quarries with a steam excavator to keep construction moving. You’ll face key decisions about which resources to sell on the market or export to neighboring cities to maximize your city’s income and growth.\n\nTo ensure your city thrives, you’ll manage a journal of tasks that will help you address urgent issues and develop strategic improvements. Completing tasks not only rewards you but also elevates your status as mayor, unlocking new opportunities and growth for your city.\n\nAs your city grows, connecting with fellow mayors becomes essential. Create a union and invite others to join, fostering a community where you can exchange resources, tackle challenges together, and discuss city issues openly. This collaboration can help you overcome obstacles and bring prosperity to all members.\n\nA bustling city is a profitable one. Collect taxes from commercial buildings to expand your city’s territory, build new infrastructure, and grow your population. As your reputation and resources grow, you’ll have the opportunity to construct more advanced buildings, meet the rising demands of your citizens, and create a city that’s uniquely yours in Steam City.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more fun, casual games to choose from.

Hire top-tier trainers, equip your gyms with cutting-edge gear, and plan strategic fight plans. Scout talented fighters, recruit rising stars and guide them to championship glory. Every decision shapes your path to becoming the ultimate MMA manager.\n\nHow to Play MMA Manager 2\n\nTo become a champion in MMA Manager 2, you’ll need to start small, build your skills, and work your way up to owning a top-tier gym. Begin by recruiting your first fighter through the roster, where you can either hire a premade fighter or create your own from scratch. When making a fighter, you’ll first choose a weight class and skin type: these don’t affect performance. Then, customize your fighter’s identity with their name, hometown, and country of origin. Next, select a fight-style background, which determines their initial skill set.\n\nFighting Styles and Primary Skills:\n\nWrestling: Punches, takedowns, ground grappling. Wrestlers dominate ground positions, delivering powerful blows while keeping opponents pinned.\n\nTaekwondo: High kicks. A risky style relies on complex, high-impact kicks that can be devastating when executed effectively.\n\nMuay Thai (Elbows): Elbows, clinch work. Close-combat specialists use clinches and swift elbow combos to wear opponents down.\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ): Takedowns, ground grappling, submissions. BJJ fighters control ground situations and force opponents to submit with painful holds.\n\nKickboxing: Punches, low kicks. A striking style blending fast punches and relentless low kicks to overwhelm opponents.\n\nMuay Thai (Knees): Knees, clinch work. Knee-focused Muay Thai fighters deal significant damage with precision strikes during close combat.\n\nAfter recruiting, your fighters will begin competing in matches, but their actual growth happens in the gym. Train them to enhance their strengths or develop new skills. Training uses stamina, which gradually replenishes over time but cannot exceed a fighter’s maximum capacity. Check stamina levels in the gym view using the stamina ring, and ensure you’re training fighters as soon as they’re ready.\n\nEach match becomes progressively more complex, requiring strategic planning and practical training. Winning fights brings you closer to becoming a professional and achieving your dream of owning the best gym in the business!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore some of our most exciting sports titles, starting with Basketbros, a fast-paced basketball game offering both online and offline gameplay.

This game is ideal for card players, especially solitaire fans, as it is intuitive to pick up quickly with similar solitaire gameplay but with a slight twist—cards are not in laid out the same way, suits don't matter and rank order can go from high to low to high again!\n\nHow to Play Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks\n\nThe aim of the game is to match cards by rank. Tap a card that is either one rank higher or lower than the card you are working from. For example, if you have a 5, you can play a 6 or a 4. This sequence can continue in either direction (e.g., 4 → 5 → 6 or 6 → 5 → 4).\n\nThe Table Setup\n\nThe game begins with a dynamic layout of cards on the table, blending uncovered cards. You can play with covered cards waiting to be revealed. Your objective is to build sequences using only the uncovered cards, so strategize carefully to unlock new possibilities.\n\nAt the bottom of the game board, you’ll find your home base card, the foundation of your sequences. Every move you make starts here, guiding your progress through the game. Next to your home base is the deck of cards, your lifeline when you run out of moves on the table. Draw from this deck to refresh your strategy and keep the game moving forward.\n\nPay close attention to how the cards are arranged, and start planning your moves to reveal hidden opportunities and outsmart the deck!\n\nSuits don’t matter, so you can match cards regardless of their suit, focusing solely on their numerical value.\n\nThe key to winning is to strategize your moves. It’s often best to start with a lower-numbered card so you have more flexibility to build sequences. Aim to clear as many cards as possible with each move by carefully planning increases and decreases (e.g., a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 removes multiple cards).\n\nIf no moves are available, you will be prompted to draw a card from the deck. The card you draw becomes the new card you must build from. If no uncovered cards are playable, you’ll also need to draw from the deck.\n\nThe game becomes more challenging as you go. Occasionally, you may receive prompts to add five more cards to the table, increasing the difficulty. If you make a move you regret, use the Undo button to revise your strategy.\n\nKings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks Tip\n\nIf you have several sequence options, prioritize moves that remove the most cards from the table or deck. For example, a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 can clear more cards than a straight increase like 4 → 5 → 6.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more casual game fun? We've got you covered! There are plenty of games worth a try, which include Backgammon Online, a timeless board game brought online with all the original rules; Bubble Shooter, a match-3 colored pop bubble game; or Tile Guru, a tile-matching game that combines mental sharpness with relaxation.\n\nRelease Date\nJuly 2020 (Android)\nSeptember 2020 (HTML5).\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 09, 2024\n\nControls\nUse the left mouse button to choose cards.\nFAQ\nHow to play Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?\n\nKings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks combines solitaire gameplay but with some twists—you need to rank cards in descending or ascending order, and suits don't count!\n\nDo you have to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?\n\nYou do not need to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks.\n\nGameplay Video",

Spend just 10 minutes a day matching vibrant 3D tiles and finding new fruit designs while mastering strategic match flips. With its unique puzzlescapes, escalating challenges, and a serene zen-inspired color palette, this game offers a perfect blend of brain training and tranquility, making it your ideal daily escape.\n\nHow to Play Tile Guru\n\nTile Guru is one of those addictive games that you find yourself playing for hours, day after day. The aim of the game is fairly simple - you need to match sets of three tiles of the same suit.\n\nYou'll start with a colorful array of fruit-themed tiles—grapes, watermelon, apples, cherries, and more. Click on each tile, and it will fall into the tile holder section. Once you get three matching tiles in the tile holder, they will disappear to make room for more. Early levels keep things simple, as all tiles are the same, making it easy to match a set of three. As the levels continue, the challenges get harder.\n\nYour tile holder is where the magic happens, and it is the part that requires the most strategy. The tile holder holds up to 7 tiles—if the holder fills up with unmatched tiles, the game is over!

They are difficult, but not impossible. Your goal is to reach the finish line, whether you can get through dangerous obstacles or not-so-dangerous ones. Any collision will likely destroy your car. Precision is key to survival, making this game ideal for anyone seeking a thrill.\n\nHow to Play Deadly Descent\n\nPrepare for the most intense, destructive races of your life in Deadly Descent.\n\nYou will be on a dirt road track or similar landscapes with nothing but speed in your control.\n\nMost of the races will leave your car completely destroyed, smashed, flipped, torn apart, catapulted off the edge, or worse. But the key is to get there first. Yes, it may sound odd, but your goal is to be the fastest in the race and survive as best you can with a banged-up car rather than suffer a fatal off-road accident.\n\nKeep your speed steady. Going fast will help you reach the finish line quickly, but it can also generate the force to destroy your car if you lose control.\n\nGive yourself enough time to brake and navigate obstacles such as smashing levers, spiked rolling crushers, sporadic crates, and more. If your car flips, you can survive if it gets banged up, no problem. But if it hits any of these objects at full force, you are likely not going to make it out of the round in one piece.\n\nEach round offers new obstacles to overcome, challenging your reflexes and strategy as you push your car to the limit.\n\nFeatures\nDestructible vehicles\nRefined physics and detailed graphics\nUnique tracks and endless challenges\nThe experience is highly realistic while remaining optimized to run smoothly on both phones and computers.\nMore Games Like This\n\nSatiate your need for speed with a few more driving games from our vast selection.

Start your career as a professional racer and climb the ranks through thrilling campaign races, upgrading your car to enhance performance along the way. With simple controls that let you navigate sharp corners effortlessly, stunning 3D graphics, realistic engine sounds, and customizable camera views, the game offers an immersive and adrenaline-packed experience.\n\nHow to Play Super Star Car\n\nSuper Star Car is all about speed, precision, and strategy as you race through an exciting career mode. Every time you finish a race in this mode, you’ll earn stars and money, helping you climb the leaderboard and unlock new opportunities. Use your winnings to upgrade your car strategically, boosting its performance and ensuring that every race feels fresh and thrilling.\n\nThe game features several tracks, each with its own unique challenges. You can select from iconic maps such as Arcport Circuit, Yafield Park, Riverside Circuit, and many more. Each track will test your skills, particularly when it comes to navigating those sharp curves. As expected, corners are the most challenging part of the game: you’ll need to hold your steering steady to maintain control. If you find yourself off the track, simply press the space bar to reset and get back into the action.\n\nTo aid your racing strategy, there’s a mini-map in the bottom-left corner of your screen, giving you a sneak peek at upcoming turns and obstacles so you can prepare ahead. Keep an eye on your speedometer, located at the bottom-right corner, to adjust your pace and avoid spinning out on tight bends.\n\nOne of the standout features of Super Star Car is its multiple view modes. You can race from a bird' s-eye view, chase your car from behind, or fully immerse yourself in the action by switching to the driver’s seat view. This versatility lets you experience the game from different perspectives, adding to its excitement and variety.\n\nThe heart of the game lies in its career mode, where every win brings you closer to the coveted championship trophy. It’s not just about crossing the finish line first; it’s also about improving your car with carefully chosen upgrades. A better-performing car will help you dominate tougher races as you progress through the campaign.\n\nGet ready to tackle adrenaline-pumping tracks and outmaneuver your rivals.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you love the thrill of F1 driving, head over to our driving games where you’ll find top titles like Moto X3M, a game that mixes high-speed adventures with a test of precision across 22 levels; PolyTrack, high-speed, low-poly racing game packed with loops, jumps, and adrenaline-fueled action or Mr Racer, a thrilling racing game where you zoom through busy streets across various locations.\n\nFeatures\nFully featured career mode\nSeveral tracks to race on\nProfile with detailed stats\nIn-car and 3rd-person views\nDetailed 3D graphics\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2021\n\nDeveloper\n\nSuper Star Car is developed by Barnzmu.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 19, 2025\n\nControls\nW or up arrow to accelerate\nAD or left and right arrow keys to steer\nC to change camera view\nSpacebar to respawn position\n\nXbox Controller supported\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Super Star Car on my phone?\n\nUnfortunately, Super Star Car is currently available to play only on desktop.\n\nIs Super Star Car free to play?\n\nSuper Star Car is free to play on desktop and can be found on CrazyGames.\n\nHow to play Super Star Car?\nW or up arrow to accelerate\nAD or left and right arrow keys to steer\nC to change camera view\nSpacebar to respawn position\nCan I use my Xbox controller to play Super Star Car?\n\nYes, Super Star Car is Xbox Controller supported.\n\nWhat is the no. 1 racing game?\n\nThere are too many racing games to choose from.

Get ready to leave your mark on the asphalt, literally!\n\nHow to Play Drift Hunters\n\nYou start Drift Hunters by selecting your car and the type of ride you want to take. You can upgrade the performance, including the brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine, with superior parts. You can also finish off your car in any color and enjoy a selection of rims on the house.\n\nThe key to this game is scoring points by drifting your car. The more you drift, the more points you get, which you can then spend in the garage to fine-tune your car.\n\nRace Tracks: Drift through diverse circuits like Nishuri, Stadium, Tyshen, and more. Each track offers a unique layout with varied curves and turns, challenging your drifting skills to the max.\n\nCars: Rack up at least 8,500 points to start unlocking cars, with the top model costing over 134k points. Every drift and upgrade gets you closer to that dream ride! If you are a beginner, you might find that it is better to focus on optimizing the performance of entry-level cars before investing all your cash on a new ride.\n\nDrift Hunters available cars:\n\nBMW M3\nToyota Supra\nHonda S2000\nFord Fiesta ST\nNissan 370Z coupe\nDodge Challenger Hellcat\nNissan GTR\nPorsche 911 GT\nAnd 18 more cars...\n\nParts & Upgrades: Customize your vehicle’s performance with upgrades to brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine.\n\nTuning: Adjust your car’s fine-tuning settings, including front and rear camber, offset, brake balance, height, and brake pressure, to perfect your drift style even without additional upgrades.\n\nVisuals: Express your style by customizing the color of your car’s body and rims, and select from a range of rim designs to complete your look.\n\nEvery car you buy can be fully tuned: turbo, brakes, engine, gearbox and weight can range from \"street\" level, the lowest, to the \"pro\", which is also the most expensive. You can fully modify these values to find the best tuning for your drift performance.\n\nSome tracks allow you to keep drifting much more easily than others. The best tracks for drifting in Drift Hunters are Emashi and Forest because of their long corners and lack of too many sharp turns. The Forest track features the longest corners, allowing for the most prolonged drifts.\n\nThe longer you drift, the more your points multiplier increases. You can use the points to buy exotic motors like the high-performance Porsche 911 GT. There are 26 fully customizable cars available to buy in total. \n\nDrift Hunters has a smooth arcade-racer feel but isn’t constrained to a racing format. Instead, you can blaze your own trail in several locations, racking up points to buy new cars and upgrades. The graphics are great for the web, but you can play the game on low-spec devices without a hiccup. It’s a must-play for drift enthusiasts!\n\nTips\nUse acceleration cautiously when approaching corners mid-drift\nDrift from side to side on straight roads to keep the drift alive\nTune up your vehicles to find the sweet spot for maximum drift\nDrive on maps with plenty of space for long, uninterrupted drifting\nMore Games Like This\n\nDriving games are super addictive when they're as good as Drift Hunters.

You race a car you've customized, on a track you might have designed yourself. This is a fast-paced, low-poly driving game featuring thrilling loops, jumps, and high-speed action where every millisecond counts.\n\nInspired by TrackMania, it challenges you to race against the clock, constantly striving to improve your time on various tracks built by you and the Polytrack community! It doesn't get any more hands-on than that.\n\nHow to Play Polytrack\n\nYou can race on the racecourses you've designed, but it's probably easier to start with the existing ones. You not only have to think about beating your own record when it comes to time, but you also need to master the craft of building for speed and precision.\n\nStart by creating your track using the game’s design tools or choosing from pre-made tracks. Customize the track with various obstacles, ramps, and curves to suit your preferences. Don't know exactly what track to build? Get help from the Polytrack community. There are plenty of forums that share design codes and customization tips.\n\nWith a built-in level editor, you can unleash your creativity by designing custom tracks. You can also export and share these tracks with others for endless racing (and design) fun.\n\nThe game will require time and patience, as you don't just go into it like other driving games, with your foot on the pedal and ready to rev and drift. Initially, the easiest tracks to build are straight lines, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you will have a track jumping over mountains, sending your car and score soaring.\n\nYou can also customize your vehicle by choosing a primary and secondary color, as well as the color of the car frame and rims.\n\nA series of premade tracks is available for those who want to begin practicing and getting a feel for other designs.\n\nPolyTrack Unique Features\n\nWhen selecting a track, you can see the best lap times recorded by verified players on it and measure yourself against them.\n\nOne cool feature that differentiates PolyTrack from other driving games is the opportunity to challenge opponents asynchronously, by selecting them from the leaderboard before starting the game, and seeing them as “ghosts” as you race the track. You can also challenge yourself by shaving off some decimals from your best time and then have your car “ghosted” on the track.\n\nAvailable Tracks\n\nThere are currently 15 Official tracks and 22 Community-made tracks:\n\nOfficial tracks:\n\n7 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n4 desert tracks\n\nCommunity tracks:\n\n9 summer tracks\n4 winter tracks\n9 desert tracks\n\nThe driving experience remains unaltered, independent of the track season: what changes is the scenery surrounding the track.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce you've mastered building your tracks, you can enjoy these other thrilling driving games: Moto X3M, where you experience high-octane motocross action with challenging courses, stunts, and exciting levels, or Drift Hunters, where you test your drifting skills in this game that features a variety of cars and tracks designed for perfecting those thrilling drifts.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 2023\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 17, 2025\n\nControls\nDriving Controls\nWASD / arrow keys = drive\nEnter / R = restart\nEditor Controls\nLeft-click = build\nRight-click + move = move camera view\nMiddle mouse-click + move = rotate camera view\nMouse-scroll = zoom in / out\nShift + mouse-scroll / ZC = height up / down\nQE = rotate camera view to the left / right\nR / Space = rotate item\nX = delete item\nT = test drive\nFAQ\nHow to play Polytrack?\n\nIn Polytrack, you race a car you customize on a track you've designed yourself.

In Moscow Metro Driver 3D, you’re responsible for getting passengers safely through the underground tunnels of the Russian capital. Don’t worry, you’ll get a full tutorial and training.\n\nYou have quite a sophisticated dashboard to work with, with features like switching camera views to see the train in motion from the side, peeking inside the passenger cars, or looking straight ahead through the windshield. Feel free to explore each perspective as you make your run.\n\nBefore departing a station, use the door switch to open and close the doors. When the doors open, grab the megaphone and make an announcement to your passengers. After all, communication is key on a busy metro line.\n\nUse the X scale to get the train moving. Keep an eye on your speed and don’t go above the limit, but don’t crawl along either, or you’ll never make it to the next stop on time.\n\nWhen it’s time to stop, approach the platform carefully. The front of your train should be no more than 3 meters from the rail. Miss your mark, and you’ll find yourself with half the train in the tunnel and half out, not exactly a great look for a new driver.\n\nSpeed controls:\n\nX1 – X4 are your forward speeds, with X4 being the fastest.\n0 is neutral.\nT1 – T3 control your braking, with T3 bringing you to a complete stop.\n\nOnce you’ve reached your desired speed, set it to 0 to maintain your pace.\n\nYour current speed limit appears in red, while the following one shows in yellow. Keep an eye on both so you can start slowing down in time. You’ll also see how many meters remain in your route, giving you an idea of how much longer you’ll be driving.\n\nIf you stop too far from the platform railing, passengers won’t be able to board, and you won’t get the door signal. If that happens, ease the train forward a little until everything lines up.\n\nAnd if you miss your stop altogether? Just keep going to the next station and be sure to make an announcement to your passengers.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore our driving games to stay behind the wheel.

Navigate through thrilling levels, jumping over gaps and dodging obstacles. Get ready for an adrenaline rush as you tackle exciting challenges on your way to victory!\n\nHow to Play Crazy Motorcycle\n\nCrazy Motorcycle combines Minecraft graphics with classic 80s arcade gameplay. Your movements are limited to left, right, up, down, and jumping. Simple but all crucial to your survival on this obstacle-ridden bike course. You also have control over the sound being on or off. Ah, the good old days were when choice was more tangible. The lack of frills is no measure of fun in this thrilling bike race in the sky.\n\nThere are four available worlds to play in, with different terrains and obstacles in each of them. In every world, there are 16 stages to complete before getting to the end.\n\nThe object of the game is to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards to fatten your final score. You will mainly be going straight with the occasional moves to the right and left to avoid hitting obstacles or, worse, meeting your fate with the abyss below you by falling off the race track.\n\nYou can't get away with a straight run, and even on level one, you must maneuver to avoid falling to your demise.\n\nThe race course is also not entirely linear, and there are breaks in the course with nothing below you but chance. This is where your jumps will come into play. The wider the gap, the more speed and jump you will need to cross the divide.\n\nIf you see a series of swerving roads ahead with moving obstacles, slow down to retain your balance and avoid getting knocked off the road. The key to moving items is to move with them, even if you get close to the edge. Not all items can be jumped over.\n\nGrab the red flags along the road; they represent checkpoints and allow you to restart from there should you fall, while yellow flags let you collect coins, which you can use to buy new voxelated skins in the menu.\n\nLastly, you can compete against other players by checking your score against theirs in the leaderboard, also available in the main menu.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBuckle up or wear your helmet and check out more of our driving games! Moto X3M takes you on a wild ride with daring motorcycle stunts and challenging tracks.\n\nAn additional option to drive a car is represented by Eggy Car, while if you are looking for a totally different alternative, you can try Little Alchemy.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJune 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nJul 14, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD or arrow keys to move\nSpace to jump\nLeft mouse button to interact with in-game UI\nFAQ\nWhat is the motorcycle arcade game called?\n\nPlenty of motorcycle games are available to play online - a few popular ones include Moto X3M and Crazy Motorcycle.\n\nHow do you avoid falling off the edge in Crazy Motorcycle game?\n\nMake subtle moves.

Some of these high-octane vehicles can also be unlocked simply by watching ads.\n\nMountain mode\n\nIn the rugged mountain mode, take on everyday tasks such as picking up workers from factories and guiding tourists through breathtaking landscapes, like a scenic water dam nestled among the hills. The winding roads and picturesque vistas will challenge your driving skills, making every trip an unforgettable adventure. Be careful not to get stuck because if you do, you'll have to start over.\n\nCity mode\n\nMeanwhile, city mode thrusts you into the hustle and bustle of urban life. Navigate narrow streets, pick up commuters, and drop them off at their destinations, whether it’s a restaurant for breakfast or the office for a busy day ahead. You’ll have to master city traffic, pedestrians, and tight turns while keeping your passengers safe and satisfied.\n\nWith pretty realistic graphics, sounds, and dynamic gameplay, the Bus Driving Simulator brings the thrill of real-world bus driving to your mousepad. Conquer treacherous terrain, race through busy streets, and take on heart-pounding missions in a variety of weather conditions.

It combines high-speed thrills with a test of precision and timing across 22 adrenaline-filled levels. Each course introduces fresh, intense obstacles from gravity-defying loops to dangerous ramps and explosive traps that keep you on the edge of your seat. Gear up, strap on your helmet, and prepare to perform stunts of a lifetime as you race against the clock.\n\nHow to Play Moto X3M\n\nSit back, hold on tight, and get ready for a thrilling bike ride (with pretty exciting music). Each level of Moto X3M ramps up the thrill with increasingly complex obstacles that require precision, skill, and, above all, patience. Don't get too distracted by the fun; every mistake comes at a price, and that price is time. And time is the key to nailing the coveted 3-star rating, where only the fastest, cleanest runs bring you victory.\n\nMastering each level means finding that sweet spot between speed, braking, and stunt work, all while dodging obstacles designed to slow you down.\n\nMoto X3M offers 22 distinct tracks, each progressively challenging. While the early levels ease you, later tracks become obstacle-filled gauntlets of ramps, loops, and hazards. With each track’s unique layout, there’s plenty of replay value as you strive to beat your best time. The game can get pretty addictive.\n\nAs you conquer each course, you will earn stars and can use them to unlock two new bikes! It’s more than just a visual upgrade; new bikes give you added motivation to return to tracks and push for faster times and higher scores.\n\nMoto X3M features vibrant 2D graphics, fluid physics-based animation, and a playful, slapstick tone. Crashes are humorous, with ragdoll physics and cartoon-style explosions keeping the action lighthearted. Each track has its own theme, from sunny beaches to underground caves, while energetic music and sound effects heighten the thrill of racing and performing stunts.\n\nPush your speed to the max, but don't rush into unknown obstacles without caution. Every fall adds seconds, impacting your star rating. Aim to squeeze in as many air stunts as you can over big jumps to shave precious seconds off your final time!\n\nAdvanced Moves\nFlips & Combos: Chain flips on long jumps to reduce your final time.\nBack Wheel Boost: Landing on your rear wheel at the right angle gives a speed boost.\nTimer Delay Trick: Wait for the perfect moment to start moving and effectively pause the timer.\nHidden Shortcuts: Some levels allow creative routes to bypass obstacles or save time.\nGame Levels\n\nLevels unlock sequentially, growing in difficulty from beginner-friendly ramps to extreme obstacles. Stars earned on each level unlock new bikes, adding visual variety and motivation to replay tracks. Checkpoints prevent frustration, letting you retry tricky sections without restarting the entire level.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nKeep your wheels on the ground for maximum speed when needed, but don’t hesitate to brake approaching tricky obstacles.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many games in the Moto X3M series, like Basketball Legends and Basketball Stars. You can also browse our driving category and try popular titles where you drive fast in Snow Rider 3D. How fast can you go on ice?

Obstacles lurk at every turn, and if you’re not careful, slowing down could send you spiraling into an abyss.\n\nMega Ramps is the ultimate test of your driving skills, packed with high-speed thrills and perilous obstacles.

If you get thrown off, you’ll face a brutal penalty: no car collisions for a full five minutes! In another high-stakes mode, you’ll choose between fleeing or attacking. Opt to shoot, and you’ll rain bombs from above, sabotaging the arena floor to send enemy cars tumbling into oblivion. Choose to flee, and you’ll be the one racing for your life!\n\nOther challenges include chaotic bomb-passing rounds, where you must avoid detonation on a board packed with frantic cars.

There is a serene exhilaration of soaring when you get the hang of the controls, but it doesn't last long. You need to land! Every flight pushes your skills to the limit as you navigate unpredictable terrains and intense weather conditions. Will you make a smooth touchdown or end in a spectacular, fiery crash?\n\nHow to Play Crazy Plane Landing\n\nYour main objective in Crazy Plane Landing is to take flight, avoid obstacles, and land your plane safely. This sounds easy enough, but there is a reason some airline pilots need over a thousand hours of flight time for certification. It isn't easy!\n\nYou’ll need to master both acceleration and steering with simple game gears—hold the left mouse button, space bar, W key, or up arrow to accelerate and gain altitude, giving your plane just enough speed to soar through the skies. As you navigate, use the left mouse button or the left and right arrow keys to steer your plane on course. There are arrows pointing to the destination landing strip. Take your hand off the acceleration and steer towards the landing pad.\n\nPrecision is key—smoothly adjust your trajectory to avoid obstacles and line up your approach for a perfect landing. The right balance between speed and direction will ensure a safe landing. Don't expect too many smooth landings to begin with. This game is called \"crazy\" for a reason.\n\nYou have a few airplanes to choose from but can only upgrade once you've accumulated a significant amount of points. Upgrades are well worth all the crashes that get you accumulated points. You not only get to choose your plane, but you can upgrade engines, boosts, and bonuses.\n\nThe better the plane, the more control you have over your speed and steering.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more driving games to continue the fun. Try Moto X3M, a bike racing game with 22 levels, each of which poses a new challenge and provides the opportunity to perform wild stunts on your dirt bike, or Drift Hunters, a 3D drifting game with an excellent selection of tracks and plenty of tuned-up cars.\n\nRelease Date\nJuly 2021 (Android and iOS)\nMarch 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nMar 27, 2024\n\nControls\nHold the left mouse button / space / W / up arrow to accelerate\nUse the left mouse button / AD / right-left arrow to steer\nFAQ\nIs Crazy Plane Landing realistic?\n\nWhile you don't get a view of sitting behind the pilot's seat, the control you have during take-off and landing is quite a realistic simulation.\n\nCan you do stunts in Crazy Plane Landing?\n\nThere isn't exactly a lot of room for stunts in Crazy Plane Landing, and the aim of the game is essentially to land your airplane safely.\n\nGameplay Video",

Customize vehicles and build your own routes using an inventory with various objects. A great innovation is the ability to save the created routes and be able to reuse or share them with other users via forums or other download channels.\n\nHow to Play Wrong Way\n\nThe gameplay and driving mechanisms of this wrong-way driver game remain the same, and the graphics and game engine used are also unchanged. Try out the other games first to understand how the cars handle and how to detect a wrong turn that could potentially derail your track design.\n\nAvailable objects\n\nPlayers start with a completely blank map. The only object is the parking garages and repair center. The parking lots and repair center can be moved anywhere on the map but this is the starting point of the race. Other objects available to place include:\n\nRamps\nWarehouse units\nStraight road sections\nCorner road sections\nCrossroad sections\nT-Junction sections\nBarrels\nCrash barriers\nTrees\n\nAs you can see there is a fantastic range of objects to place - the only thing missing is a police officer to chase you whilst racing! Players can design their track safely, to create fun racing circuits. Alternatively, they can develop a course designed for mayhem and creating a range of head on collisions using the ramps.\n\nThe landscapes used are reminiscent of Southern California and driving through your creation feels like you have spent years in the United States. Next, we look at the game controls.\n\nUsing the in-game controls\n\nAt first, the game controls may feel difficult to use. The WASD keys are used to move the camera view. Moreover, use the right-click mouse button to rotate the camera.\n\nTo select an object simply click it from the toolbar menu and click it again to place it on the map. To rotate an object, first click on it - the object will turn red and a rotate and remove icon will appear.\n\nEach item can be placed and rotated individually. Road sections automatically join together which can help prevent wrong tracks being created. Ensure the road sections create a logical circuit to prevent vehicles headed in the wrong direction from crashing.\n\nAvailable vehicles\n\nOnce a player has created their map, they can test it out or share it with others. Pulling off some awesome wrong way crashes or close race finishes is a great thrill, especially on your own map. The following vehicles are available for players to drive in:\n\nMercedes AMG\nPorsche 911\nAston Martin\nNissan GT\nPick-up truck\n\nThe cars all have fantastic detail and look superb. Furthermore, they handle realistically and attain some scary top speeds.

You can buy Braintorts from the red carpet, sneak into other players’ bases to steal theirs, and protect your own with traps and locks. Use boosters, outbid opponents during deliveries, and rebirth for bigger rewards as you climb the leaderboard.\n\nHow to Play Steal Brainrot Online\n\nAt its core, Steal Brainrot Online is a game about building wealth and stealing it right back from other players from around the world, all of whom have the very same objective: to accumulate as many Brainrots as possible.\n\nThe way to collect Brainrots is to, well, steal them. If you want to keep it honest, you do have the option of buying Brainrots, but you will need money.\n\nYou start off with a little bit of money, and from there you can either purchase a Brainrot from the endless conveyor of marching meme prisoners, or skip straight to the chaos by raiding someone else’s base and snatching one for “free\".\n\nOnce you steal a Brainrot, take it back to your base and place it proudly on a pillar, so that it slowly generates income as you will for more Brainrots. The more you collect, the faster your fortune grows. But if you do increase your collection, know that with wealth comes a large target on your back.\n\nJust like you can steal from other people’s bases, other players can peek inside your base and see exactly what you’ve got, which makes your defenses, like locks and temporary shields, your only real line of survival. Shields only last sixty seconds before burning out, so every moment of safety feels fleeting.\n\nStealing is both tempting and dangerous. To take someone else’s Brainrot, you need to slip into their unlocked base, carry the prize on your back, and haul it to your own collection. But the act of stealing slows you down, strips away your item use, and instantly alerts the owner. You can be sure the owner of the Brainrot you’ve snatched will come after you, knock you on the head with a hammer, and you will fall to the ground, and lose the Brainrot.\n\nIf you get the alert, be sure to chase down the thief and use your own hammer.\n\nYour progress only comes from balancing greed and caution. With enough Brainrots, money flows faster, letting you reinvest in more purchases, stronger defenses, and eventually rebirths that carry long-term rewards. But no matter how high you climb, the tension never fades because the server is full of players waiting for their chance to rob you blind.\n\nThis isn’t a cozy tycoon. It’s a social standoff disguised as a collection game, where half the fun is in the uneasy silence of players standing outside your cage, watching, and deciding whether to make their move.\n\nTip\n\nIf you get caught stealing in someone else’s base, use your home button (G on the keyboard) to transport you back home. And no, you can’t take the Brainrot with you this way.\n\nThis is an alternative version of the game by the name \"Steal a Brainrot,\" which is on Roblox.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will love some of the popular games within our casual collection, which include Little Alchemy, Little Alchemy 2, Sprunki, and Eggy Car.\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 31, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD = move\nSpace = jump\nE = interact\nMobile\nLeft joystick = move\nSwipe = look around\nUpward arrow button = jump\nHand icon button = interact\n\nYou can adjust mouse sensitivity, graphics quality, and music volume in the settings.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game Steal a Brainrot about?\n\nSteal Brainrot is a casual multiplayer game where you steal or buy Brainrots, just like those from Italian Brainrot Clicker Game, to collect as much wealth as possible, all the while other players are doing exactly the same thing, including stealing your Brainrots!\n\nWhy do people play Steal a Brainrot?\n\nSteal a Brainrot can be quite addictive as it combines escape, adventure, and challenges against other players in a fast-paced game where you steal or buy Brainrots to gather as much wealth as possible.\n\nGameplay Video"

Tackle unique design challenges, craft stunning interiors, and turn your studio into the best in town. Unleash your creativity to bring your dream designs to life and grow your decorating empire!\n\nHow to Play Designville: Merge & Design\n\nThe objective of the game is to renovate the run-down home. Louise and Robin are renovating an abandoned house to transform it into a Design Studio, the best of Designville! After a brief intro of characters, you will be introduced to a board with multiple items. Most of which are cardboard boxes from the renovation. You'll open the boxes of stuff that Robin acquired for the renovation, and the items will be placed on the board.\n\nRenovations are accomplished by merging items, designing, and decorating gardens. The grid is primarily filled with boxes, but other tiles are filled with random objects commonly found in a home, including coffee cups, pizza slices, rubber gloves, and more. Most of these items are covered in dust and cobwebs, and some can only be accessed on other levels.\n\nMerging items and discovering new ones will earn you money that can be used to enable the renovation, clearing tasks from a to-do list which will eventually lead you to the renovated Design Studio. Once the Studio is up and running, Louise and Robin will start taking orders from clients, initially friends and acquaintances, and later referrals, and they will allow the Studio to expand its reputation and complete more complex tasks.\n\nThere is one object on the grid that is most important to begin merging: a yellow bag full of corkboard push pins. Left-click on the yellow bag to fill all empty board pieces with push pins. This is where you merge. Begin merging all push pins. It takes two push pins to create another object, an eraser. As you merge, you will get more free board space, so keep clicking and merging.\n\nPotential merges and results:\n\n2 corkboard push pins = 1 eraser\n2 erasers = 1 Post-it note\n2 post its = 1 ruler\n2 rulers = 1 round ruler\n2 protractors = 1 pencil\n2 pencils = 1 highlighter\n2 highlighters = 1 drawing compass\n2 drawing compasses = 1 stapler\n2 staplers = 1 color sample\n\nKeep merging and find more and more new items.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of merge games, Little Alchemy is a fantastic choice, where you get to merge Earth’s four basic elements to form new discoveries.\n\nBrowse our casual games category for more popular titles like Geometry Dash, which offers a fun experience of moving following the music, or Idle Breakout, where you'll observe how your balls clear the stage.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2021 (Android, iOS and HTML5)\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nJul 08, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play the game.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the game where you merge?\n\nDesignville is a design and merge game where you renovate and decorate space by merging items.\n\nHow do you merge items in Designville?\n\nThe yellow bag on the grid board contains push pins that can be merged to form other items that also can be merged.

Each round, you will find yourself dropped into random locations around the globe, with only environmental clues to guide you in pinpointing your exact whereabouts. From cityscapes to rural roads, your surroundings become the puzzle pieces you need to analyze, turning each game into a thrilling geographical investigation.\n\nHow to Play Worldguessr\n\nIn Worldguessr, each game starts by placing you somewhere on Google Maps, and if you can’t immediately guess where you are, which is likely the majority of the time as you often start on obscure, long, and winding roads, you can move around to gather valuable clues. Search for nearby landmarks, coastlines, street signs, architectural styles, and other geographical features that might give away your location. Anything with a bit of language, like signs or billboards, can be especially useful, helping you narrow down your guess to a specific country or region.\n\nWorldguessr exploration goes beyond simple gameplay, offering an engaging way to enrich your geographic knowledge. Choose from hundreds of community-created maps tailored to different regions and themes, allowing you to travel from bustling metropolises to remote wildernesses. With unlimited rounds and a variety of challenges, you can play at your own pace or jump into multiplayer modes, where you’ll compete with friends or players worldwide.\n\nFor those moments when you feel completely stumped, Worldguessr offers a helpful hint feature. This hint won’t give away your exact location, but it will nudge you in the right direction by identifying the general part of the world—such as the continent—where you are. From there, the challenge is yours to explore, observe, and deduce the country, city, and even the town where you’ve been dropped, relying on your own skills to make the final call.\n\nOnce you make your guess, Worldguessr reveals just how close—or far—you were from the actual location, helping you refine your skills over time. This unique blend of learning and adventure makes Worldguessr perfect for geography enthusiasts, travelers at heart, or anyone who loves a good challenge.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like this game, you will want to browse our casual games for even more of the same.

The true challenge is how easy it is for your car actually to drive across that path.\n\nNext challenge – draw a line to the target, but now there's a wall in your way. Remember, your car can’t fly! So, think about how to draw your path – you don’t have to go over the wall; you can go under it! As you go, you'll see that drawing a straight line is harder than it looks. If you don’t start the line from behind your car, it’ll just dangle off into oblivion.\n\nHow do you get over an L-shape? Or a huge gap in the ground? And the challenges keep coming. By level 5, your engine shuts off, so you’ll need your physics brain to figure out how to use hills and momentum to get across.\n\nSome levels have trampoline-like springs that’ll launch you toward your target. The challenges change each time, keeping you on your toes. Buckle up because it's going to be a bumpy ride, depending on how well you draw!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe fun has just begun!

As Commander of the A.O.D squad, you lead the charge against Mr. Ivil's ruthless thugs, determined to find the lost Inola project. With stunning isometric graphics, build your technological kingdoms and thwart the enemy's destructive ambitions. Will you save mankind or succumb to darkness?\n\nHow to Play AOD - Art of Defence\n\nYour mission in AOD Art of Defense begins with an urgent message from Mr. Ivil—find the blueprints of the fabled Inola Project at all costs—even if it means reducing the city to rubble. Time is of the essence. Meanwhile, Ich Nevel warns of an imminent large-scale assault on your bases. The stakes couldn’t be higher, and it’s up to you to defend humanity’s last hope. You have one goal - to protect your base at all costs.\n\nDynamic battles ensure that every moment is filled with action. Combining elements of Tower Defense, RPG, and tactical strategy, the game features over 500 sectors for real-time warfare, offering a variety of environments—from small villages to massive abandoned megapolises. You’ll face challenges in exciting new Tower Defense modes like escape, fog, and survival.\n\nThe aim is strategically deploying siege houses, tanks, and armed trucks to stop enemy forces before they breach your defenses. With over 1,000 tower upgrades, including tanks, miniguns, and air defense systems, your arsenal is as vast as powerful. Along the way, you’ll unlock six unique heroes, each with their own abilities to level up and master. From nuclear bombs to ionic satellite strikes and ballistic barrages, a range of devastating boosters will turn the tide in your favor.\n\nEvery successful defense wave rewards you with crystals, essential for upgrading your arsenal. The longer you survive, the greater the rewards, but enemies will become stronger with each attack. Hundreds of card upgrades allow you to customize your towers for maximum efficiency, keeping your strategies fresh and adaptable.\n\nSet in a near-future world devastated by nuclear wars, 70% of the population has been wiped out. The survivors face constant terror from Mr. Ivil, who has united gangs into a brutal army bent on finding the Inola Project blueprints. His forces leave no settlement untouched, robbing and killing indiscriminately. Your task is to stop them and save what remains of the planet.\n\nIn this endless survival mode, your tactics and preparation are key. Build your defenses wisely, place your siege houses strategically, and upgrade your resources to keep pace with the escalating challenge. Each location demands new strategies and better equipment, pushing your tactical skills to the limit.\n\nWhether you’re battling through small villages or abandoned megapolises, the world's fate depends on you. With the power of innovative weapons, unique heroes, and an array of upgrades, you hold the key to humanity’s survival.

Anything is possible in the variety of games offered. You will find yourself leaping across deadly gaps, racing through winding tracks on a speedy bike, and making daring escapes from high-security prisons. Each mode offers new thrills, so get ready to test your reflexes.\n\nHow to Play Obby World: Squid Escape\n\nObby World: Squid Escape throws is a mix of parkour challenges, with each game different from the last. Each game tests your timing, balance, and quick thinking. The game begins by letting you choose from a set of different obstacle-based modes, each with its own style and surprises.\n\nYou’ll face multiple rounds of challenges, such as:\n\nRed Light, Green Light: The classic stop-and-go test. Run when the light is green, freeze when it’s red. Move at the wrong time, and you’re out.\n\nCarousel Round: Follow the instructions: “run into a room,” “get into groups of two or three,” or “go solo.” It sounds simple, but without a way to communicate with other players, teamwork becomes tricky and tense.\n\nSkywalk Courses: Balance across oversized objects floating in the sky—giant coffee cups, donuts, chocolate bars, and more. One misstep and you’ll tumble straight down, ending your round.\n\nOther modes keep the action fresh, from racing down twisting bike tracks to sneaking through prison breakouts. Each one pushes you to react quickly and stay sharp under pressure.\n\nThe controls are simple, but the levels demand precision. One moment you’re leaping across glowing rainbow platforms, the next you’re dodging traps or trying to outsmart guards. Success depends on timing, agility, and a little creativity in how you approach obstacles.\n\nWith colorful environments, unpredictable twists, and nonstop movement, Obby World: Squid Escape is built for players who want parkour challenges that keep them on their toes.\n\nChoose your mode. In Rainbow Mode, you’ll dash across glowing platforms in a lively, colorful world. Bicycle Mode shifts the challenge to two wheels, where speed, stunts, and sharp maneuvers keep the race intense. Prison Escape raises the stakes with traps to dodge, guards to evade, and clever moves needed to break free. Each mode has its own style of thrill, and requires quick reflexes and sharp timing. Between games, you can personalize your character with outfits and accessories, giving your hero a distinct look.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like the wild antics of this game, you may like games like Eggy Car, where you have to navigate an egg in a car through obstacles, ensuring it doesn't crack!

Flying knives are generally a no-no, but in this game, they are the only way to progress to new blades and skins.\n\nSlice Master reviewed\n\nWe really enjoyed the fun tactile slicing of this game. The sounds are just perfect. I liked how the kids had to work out which mathematical operator was the best to go for at the end of the level - \"is x4 better than +60?\" Also, because you play it with just one button, it was a game that the whole family could have a go at, even from the youngest of us. In fact, our grandparents also got involved and turned out to be pretty competitive.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase\n\nHow to Play Slice Master\n\nSlice Master is a one-button game controlled by the space pad on your keyboard or the left click on your mouse. All the control lies in this one simple movement. The game has an ASMR quality, and the consistent slicing is oddly soothing to the ear.\n\nThe aim is simple: slice everything in sight: fruit, shapes, walls, furniture, and more. You can slice most things, but don’t add the white wall to your target list—it’s just a holding material for your knife.\n\nYou will get to shop along the way, using the coins accumulated to unlock sharper blades, swords, maces, and more: anything to help you slice even more!\n\nTips\nStay away from the pink spiked metal shapes. They are too strong for your knife and will take you straight back to the beginning of the round. Sometimes these can be found at the bottom of a pile of objects to slice, so be careful to lift your knife in time to avoid them\nHit the correct numeric target at the end of each level to multiply your points by the target number and boost your score.\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf casual games are your style, you can find a slew of them in our casual game category.

The higher the number, the more points you will receive, so aim high.\n\nCan I cut the white pillar in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, the white pillar can’t be cut, but you can attach it and use it as a safety net to prevent it from hitting the ground.\n\nCan I go backwards in Slice Masters?\n\nNo, you can only go forward in Slice Masters.\n\nHow many knives can I unlock in Slice Masters?\n\nYou can unlock 9 knives in Slice Masters so keep those points coming.\n\nGameplay Video",

Groove your way over and under obstacles to keep the musical momentum alive. If you slip up, it’s back to the beginning! Inspired by the original Geometry Dash, this is a Scratch version, bringing the classic rhythm-based gameplay to your browser.\n\n\"This game became our family obsession during lockdown, but we have recently returned to play it. Combining simple controls and a high level of challenge makes for a fun experience we can all enjoy. Because the play is in time with the music, it’s also a good way to develop children’s sense of timing and musicality. Sometimes we’ve even played it once the kids are in bed, to see if we can improve our skills for the next family session.\"\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Geometry Game\n\nGeometry Dash is a 2D platformer game where you are in charge of moving a shape through a bunch of obstacles, all to the beat of the music. The square actually moves by itself, and all you have to do is click to jump when necessary and use the up/down arrows to steer vehicles. The way you dodge obstacles is often in sync with the beat, so make sure your sound is on and enjoy the experience!\n\nThe key to the game is timing. The levels themselves scroll automatically, and hitting spikes, walls, or other hazards results in an instant crash and restart. If you fail, it's back to the beginning. The constant die-and-retry loop will have you quickly memorizing the patterns of each level and, more importantly, the precise timing of crucial jumps. This dynamic is what makes the game addictive.\n\nListen to the beat\n\nGeometry Game is a music game, and many jumps and movements are synced to the beat of the background music, so paying attention to the rhythm is not really an option. Practice Mode lets you place checkpoints to learn tricky sections without starting over, so it's a good place to start or go back to if you're having trouble completing levels.\n\nWatch the obstacles\n\nLevels also feature unique objects like portals, pads, and orbs. Portals can flip gravity, change speed, or switch vehicle modes. Jump pads automatically launch you, and orbs trigger special actions mid-air. These elements replace traditional power-ups, creating dynamic challenges that keep each level pretty much unpredictable.\n\nTips & Tricks\nPractice Mode. Use Practice Mode to break a level into smaller sections. Place checkpoints at tricky spots and repeat until you can clear each segment consistently. This builds muscle memory and makes full runs much easier.\nFollow the Rhythm. The game’s music often cues obstacle timing. Pay attention to beats and sync your jumps to the song. You can try humming the beat to get the rhythm down.\nGeometry Game Reviews\n\nThe game has received positive reviews from critics. Softpedia praised the game's style, saying, \"While it can get a bit frustrating sometimes, you can always complete the stages using the practice mode and then jump into the many different user-generated levels.\"\n\nGeometry Game History\n\nGeometry Dash started without a clear vision, according to the developer RobTop. It could have moved in any direction. It started as a template with a cube that could crash and jump, and evolved into the smash-hit game it is today.\n\nWhen the game was first launched, it was called Geometry Jump and only had seven levels. Later on, it was renamed \"Geometry Dash.\" Currently, there are four free versions of the game, one being \"Geometry Dash Lite,\" which now includes the first 13 levels from the full version.\n\nFeatures\nChallenging levels that vary in difficulty from hard to almost impossible\nSimple controls make the game intuitive to learn from the start\nExcellent music that compels you to reach the next part of the track\nFun gameplay synced to the beat!\nMore Geometry Games\n\nIf you like playing Geometry Dash for free in your web browser, check out Geometry Dash Subzero.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more games played in time with musical rhythms, check out FNF, a popular freestyle music game.

Every layer of the sea holds surprises, from schools of small fish to rare creatures hidden in the depths.\n\nYour goal is to cast your line as far and deep as possible. Timing is crucial. Tap when the color bar hits green to launch your line at maximum power, yellow for a solid throw, and red for a weak cast. Once your hook is in the water, keep tapping to push it deeper and uncover new species.\n\nFour key stats that influence your fishing include strength, weight, rebound, and resistance. They determine how far your hook travels, how deep it sinks, and how many fish you can bring in with a single cast.\n\nUpgrades drive your progress. Boost strength for longer throws, increase weight for deeper dives, upgrade rebound for better water bounces, and up the resistance to pull in more fish at once. Unlock new zones, collect rare catches, and expand your character roster as you advance.\n\nTo accelerate progress, watch ads to earn extra rewards and invest them in upgrades. With patience and careful upgrades, you can steadily work your way to fishing mastery.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty of games to keep you entertained.

But first, here’s a letter from the previous owner that will give you an idea of your situation:\n\nHi,\n\nCongrats on buying my farm! Sorry to hear you got stranded overnight - wish I could’ve helped fix your car. I don’t remember that rock being on the road… strange. Anyway, I asked around for help, and hopefully, you’ll find an oil pan soon.\n\nYou were right about the sunrises - they're stunning, much better than in the city! The soil here is top-notch too. Too bad I had to leave in such a rush. Life happens...\n\nThis land is the best spot on that flat hilltop, right near the road. It’s called Roadside Farm, but feel free to rename it. Oh, and please take care of Clarabella!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJim Grey\n\nNow that you’re settling in, it’s time to start farming. Each day brings new rewards, so be sure to check in and claim them. The key to a thriving farm is planting, harvesting, and managing your resources wisely. Sow your seeds, take care of your animals, and keep an eye on your barn and warehouse to track what you’ve gathered. As you grow your farm, you’ll have the chance to expand your land, unlocking even more opportunities to cultivate crops and raise livestock.\n\nClover is an essential crop for your animals. Cows, turkeys, and goats love it, and if you have bees, they’ll pollinate it, producing honey before harvest. Clover is also used in the production of milk, black feathers, and white feathers. Wheat is another staple: grind it at the Dutch Mill to make flour or use it to feed your sheep. It’s a key ingredient in making flour, vodka, wool, and black wool. If you need milk, make sure to feed your Holstein cows. A full cow is a happy cow, and happy cows keep your farm running smoothly.\n\nYour farm has several important buildings to manage. The Dutch Mill turns wheat into flour, and keeping it filled will power the windmill. The barn stores essentials like wheat, clover, and flour, while the warehouse holds resources such as honey, sugar, oxygen, and propane. As you progress, you’ll gain access to even more supplies, including gear, decorations, chests, and medals. Keep an eye on your stockpile to prepare for the next task.\n\nWhile ripe crops are beautiful to look at, don’t forget to harvest and replant to keep your farm productive. Wheat should always be replenished, and replanting clover on eight plots of soil will ensure a steady supply. Adding sacks of wheat to the Dutch Mill will keep your flour production running smoothly. The more you maintain your farm, the more opportunities you’ll unlock, allowing you to expand even further. Check the map to see just how vast your farm can become.\n\nBeyond the daily farm routine, there are plenty of ways to engage with the world around you. If you enjoy a relaxed farming experience, you’ll love the peaceful rhythm of planting and harvesting, accompanied by soothing animations and calming sounds. For those who like a challenge, competitions, achievements, horse racing, and leaderboards offer ways to test your skills and earn permanent prizes. The farming co-op lets you collaborate with fellow players, whether by sending Wedding Doves to ceremonies or trading produce at the Market.\n\nNeighbors are a valuable part of farm life. The more neighbors you have, the more gifts you’ll receive, helping you progress faster. You can also personalize your farm with beautiful artwork and decorations, customizing both your Farmhouse and Log Cabin. If you feel like exploring, venture into the surrounding landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots, or head to the mines to uncover valuable ores and hidden riches.\n\nWith so much to do, you can play Country Life Meadows your way. Relax and unwind with hours of farming fun, compete to showcase your skills, or grow your farm into a flourishing empire. The possibilities are endless: so start planting and watch your farm come to life!\n\nFeatures\nPlay to Relax: Unwind with hundreds of hours of farming fun.

Stay alert as other players may try to steal your progress, adding an exciting twist to the challenge. Strategize and race to complete your bridge first in this thrilling test of skill and speed!\n\nHow to Play Bridge Race\n\nBridge Race is an oddly satisfying game where you aim to collect as many blocks of your color as possible and carry them across the board to build a bridge. The objective is to create a path that leads you to the next collection area and, ultimately, to the finish line. Victory is sweet, but the challenge continues as each round gets more difficult.\n\nThe game is designed to be both simple and rewarding, with delicate sounds that create a satisfying atmosphere. You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.\n\nBut you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category title called Blob Opera, a game that uses a machine learning model trained on authentic voices to make it easy for anyone to create amazing operatic music.

Build magnificent cities, develop resources, and create a unique culture while engaging in trade and diplomacy. Expand your influence, make historic discoveries, and craft wonders that will be remembered for centuries. Your choices shape the future of your empire: lead wisely!\n\nHow to Play Empire City\n\nEmpire City is a classic management game set in ancient times where you get to build an entire city, including roadways, residential homes, waterways, workshops, and more -- all from a blank slate with a bit of help from two close advisors: Julia and Flavius.\n\nThe game starts with a full intro from Julia and Flavius, which will walk you through step by step how to build your city. Once you have the hang of it, you're on your own. But not to worry, help from your advisors is just a click away.\n\nJulia and Flavius guide you through the following directions:\n\nJulia: \"Welcome to the city, Prefect! I’m Julia. I run an inn here, and I know everything about everyone. This is Flavius, the architect.\"\n\nFlavius: \"My projects can do the talking for me! The first one is a residential building. Let’s get to work!\"\n\nJulia: \"Remember, every building in the city must be connected to a road.\"\n\nAction: You get to build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"Congratulations, Prefect! The building is ready. We can house people in it now.\"\n\nJulia: \"People?! There’s barely room for one citizen. The building needs to be upgraded.\"\n\nAction: Build a house.\n\nFlavius: \"Prefect, we have a problem. We need clay to make the house more spacious, but it’s mined outside the city.\"\n\nJulia: \"If it’s even mined at all! The clay quarry is in bad shape, and the tool storage is totally dilapidated. But our Prefect can solve that, right?\"\n\nAction: Fix the clay quarry.\n\nJulia: \"Now we can hire a manager! But that can happen later. First, we need to build a road to deliver the clay to the city.\"\n\nAction: Build a road.\n\nFlavius: \"The road is wonderful, Prefect! Collect the mined clay, and my people will deliver it to the construction site right away.\"\n\nAction: Collect the clay.\n\nFlavius: \"Thank you for the help. I’ll get to work upgrading the house right now!\"\n\nJulia: \"You and Flavius are doing wonderfully! Let’s upgrade another house. It could use a second floor, with a good view of the city.\"\n\nFlavius: \"Regular clay isn’t enough to build another floor. This requires a sturdier material, such as clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Alas, this material isn’t produced in our city. Although the Prefect could give orders to build a special workshop.\"\n\nJulia: \"If you don’t want to wait, use gems! Their shine speeds up any project. The first time is free, though.\"\n\nAction: Use gems.\n\nFlavius: \"Very grand, Prefect. Now we won’t lack building materials. Give the order to produce clay mixture.\"\n\nJulia: \"Production can take a long time. When it ends, a clay mixture icon will appear above the workshop.\"\n\nAction: Wait for production to finish.\n\nFlavius: \"It’s ready, Prefect! Tap the icon to move the mixture to the warehouse.\"\n\nAction: Move the mixture to the warehouse.\n\nJulia: \"So, are we going to upgrade the house or just pretend that it’s intentionally unfinished?\"\n\nFlavius: \"Please accept this scroll. I sketched out some improvements. Remember, Prefect, Julia and I are always here to support you!\"\n\nYou're on your own after this training. Continue building your empire and make Julia and Flavius proud, Prefect!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are in Empire City, you may like more games within our casual game category, so go ahead and have a look!

This modded version of Incredibox by NyankoBfLolCombine gives you DJ control to mix loops, vocals, beats, and melodies, pretty much creating your own musical style. The game features vibrant characters and sounds for a completely immersive experience full of rhythmic possibilities. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just love experimenting, it’s a fun and engaging way to express your creativity.\n\nHow to Play Sprunki\n\nSprunki is a quirky, surreal, music-based game that combines creativity with creepy twists. And yes, it does get a bit creepy, depending on your choices, so if horror is not your genre, then this may be a bit of a challenge.\n\nYour goal is to assemble a bizarre band of unique characters and create melodies by assigning them different outfits and accessories. Each customization changes its sound, letting you experiment with endless musical combinations.\n\nThe game starts lightheartedly as you craft a cheerful choir. Choose from avatars like TV heads, satellite dishes, and Medusa-like figures, each contributing to the band's unique vibe. The choice is all yours. There are different combinations to uncover hidden tunes, mixing cheerful beats or darker undertones, depending on your choices.\n\nAs you progress, the game takes a darker turn. Innocent melodies morph into haunting soundscapes, and your once-jolly avatars begin to appear cursed. The cheerful tree might display missing person posters, and the formerly harmonious sounds turn dissonant, with eerie visuals creeping in. The more phases you unlock, the more unsettling the game becomes, introducing new macabre characters.\n\nWhile the gameplay focuses on experimenting with sound, each phase introduces new challenges. Some characters contribute little or refuse to \"sing,\" while others evolve into grotesque forms. The gallery section teases spoilers, revealing the grim fates of your band members after each phase.\n\nUltimately, Sprunki combines rhythm game mechanics, horror elements, and surreal storytelling. Enjoy a casual game of creating bizarre beats and interesting and unexpected transformations.\n\nSprunki Gamescape\n\nSprunki has a quirky look that pretty quickly turns dark. The lighter side has a series of characters full of vibrant colors and goofy gear. The darker side turns the skies black, characters become creepy, and dissonant sounds permeate the once whimsical tunes. There is a striking contrast between cute and creepy and horror-tinged visuals and audio.\n\nSprunki Levels\n\nSprunki doesn’t have traditional levels but progresses in phases. In the early phase, the game is bright and cheerful, and it moves into later phases where the game shifts and the visuals and music become more complex and eerie.\n\nTips & Tricks\nExperiment with different character combinations to trigger secret animations or unlock bonus characters.\nLayer sounds from beats, melodies, vocals, and effects to create full, harmonious tracks.\nUse the mute/remove function to vary your composition and build dynamic songs.\nWatch visuals for subtle clues, such as flashing characters or background changes, indicating bonuses or progression.\nLeave the game idle occasionally to spot small Easter eggs or subtle animations.\nAbout Sprunki\n\nSprunki was inspired by the popular beatboxing game Incredibox, by the indie developer NyankoBfLol. The game launched in 2024 on Scratch as a spooky take on Incredibox’s musical formula, but was removed for violent and gory content. It once again gained viral attention for its hidden horror elements.\n\nIn October 2024, Sprunki became a standalone web game on CrazyGames, playable in browsers on desktops, tablets, and phones. The final update arrived in November 2024, after which the creator discontinued further development. The game nonetheless continues to thrive so much so that there are hints of a “Sprunki Remastered” project, though no release date has been announced.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category titled Blob Opera, a creative playground where you control singing blobs, each modeled after trained opera voices.

Here, you'll confront suspects with the evidence you’ve gathered, engaging in tense dialogue to uncover their true intentions. The pressure mounts as you work to discern truth from deception, and if the severity of their actions warrants it, you’ll have the authority to send them to jail.

Papa Louie proposes an exciting alternative: stay in the bustling city and open an ice cream shop! Bake delicious cookies and craft delectable sundaes with a variety of ice cream flavors. Get ready for a delightful adventure in Papa's Scooperia!\n\nPapa’s Scooperia is a classic time management game with friendly graphics and an enjoyable, familiar storyline - you’re working at an ice cream shop trying to impress customers and make tips.\n\nYou start your job at the ice cream shop with a training day. You run through the motions of taking orders, scooping cookie dough onto baking sheets, baking to perfection, adding ice cream and toppings, and serving. It's simple as that… until more and more customers come into the shop.\n\nHow customers rate your job is essential for the score. The score points accrue and increase the player’s rank. With progress in rank, you can unlock additional customers who will become regulars to the shop, as well as new ingredients, new clothes, and new furniture to enhance your “Scooperia”.\n\nThere are four different stations in Papa’s Scooperia.\n\nOrder Station\n\nThis is where customers come in and place their ice cream orders. The typical order consists of a scoop of ice cream on a freshly baked cookie, accompanied by a choice of toppings.\n\nDough Station\n\nThis is where you will make the cookies from fresh dough. Scoop up the dough and dip it in chocolate, vanilla, or color chips.\n\nBake Station\n\nNow that you have your cookie dough ready, put it in the oven. Be sure not to burn any of the cookies. When the green bars by your cookie begin blinking, you’re nearly ready to serve. Plate your cookies, click the check, and send it out to the Build Station.\n\nBuild Station\n\nNow that you have your base, the cookie, put it all together. Add your ice cream, toppings, and any other items your customer ordered. Send the ticket and ice cream out.\n\nCustomers will score you on how well you put the order together. They will also score you on how long customers have waited for their order, how well the cookie was baked, whether the toppings are right, and how well the dish is put together.\n\nAt the end of the day, you get to rest, then return and do it all over again.\n\nBonus rounds\n\nIn between baking and cooking, you’ll get the option to play some mini-rounds to gain points. Choose to skip or play.\n\nTips\n\nWhen the shop is closed, you still get some last-minute customers coming in. They’re called closers.

        "detail": "Games»Casual»Music»Friday Night Funkin'\nFriday Night Funkin'\nShare\nRating\n9.4\n(59,724 votes)\nReleased\nJanuary 2021\nTechnology\nHTML5\nPlatform\nBrowser (desktop-only)\nWiki pages\nWikipedia - Fandom\n\nCasual\n\n1,260\n\nCartoon\n\n73\n\nSkill\n\n248\n\nMusic\n\n24\n\nArt\n\n46\n\nFriday Night Funkin’ is a casual music game that combines 80s nostalgic visuals with music battles. At its heart, it’s a rap duel simulator: you take the role of Boyfriend, a determined wannabe rapper, who faces off against opponents to prove he is worthy of dating Girlfriend, who’s there the whole time, cheering you on from the speakers. The pressure is on. To be a successful rapper, you will need to follow screen prompts, perfect your timing and pattern recognition, and most importantly, never let the beat mmm drop.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Reviewed\n\nWe love dancing and music games in our family. Friday Night Funkin is a great free rhythm game where you press buttons in time with music tracks like the classic Dance Dance Revolution machines found in the 1990s arcade. The kids love it because it's silly and retro and I like the fact that it has a fan-made feel rather than the commercial dance games that cost a lot of money.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Friday Night Funkin’\n\nThe main movement in Friday Night Funkin’ is to follow the colored arrows that scroll up and down the screen. Watch for when stationary markers overlap, and press the matching arrow key (or WASD keys) as soon as you see them overlap. Seems simple enough, but the first few rounds will have you questioning your rhythm.\n\nWith every successful match, Boyfriend gets to sing. With every arrow you miss, Boyfriend’s health score drops, quickly hurting his chances of surviving, let alone winning. When you actually get to battle, this is your time to shine and belt out the tunes. If you’re not familiar with music battles, they're similar to any other type of duel competition, but with a twist: your weapons are your words and tunes. You take turns with the opponent, and sometimes you sing together in unison.\n\nYou will hear classic songs like Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero, and the objective is to sustain as many notes as possible, holding the arrows, sometimes for their entire duration. You can add variety, which is recommended, as it will boost your score if performed well. Get it wrong, and you will feel the heat on stage.\n\nDifficulty Levels\n\nDepending on your skill level as a digital singer, you can choose from three levels of difficulty in Friday Night Funkin’: easy, normal, and hard.\n\nThe more complex the level, the faster the arrows and the sequences become.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Game Modes\n\nThe demo version of Friday Night Funkin’ includes:\n\nStory Mode. This mode takes you on a music battle journey with themed “weeks” of music, each featuring three or more songs against a pretty unique opponent. To win a week, you must clear all its tracks in a row.\n\nFree Play. This mode lets you practice individual songs so you can get some solo time in the studio to get ready for the more important battles.\n\nFriday Night Funkin' Story Mode\n\nIn Story Mode, you will follow Boyfriend on a weekly basis. He wants to win Girlfriend’s heart, but first must prove himself over time. Each week is designed with its own setting, opponent style, and themed soundtrack.\n\nWeek 1: Daddy Dearest, Girlfriend’s rockstar father.\nWeek 2: Skid & Pump, costumed kids from the Newgrounds series Spooky Month.\nWeek 3: Pico, an old Newgrounds mascot and Boyfriend’s hinted ex.\nWeek 4: Mommy Mearest, Girlfriend’s pop-star mother.\nWeek 5: A Christmas mall showdown with both parents and a sinister monster.\nWeek 6: Senpai, a cursed character in a retro dating sim setting.\nWeek 7: Tankman, a military parody character with sharp humor.\nWeekend 1: Pico takes the spotlight against Darnell, complete with animated cutscenes.\n\nHealth and Scoring\n\nYou have a health gauge at the bottom of the screen with a “tug-of-war” health bar. The more notes you get, the more the bar pushes toward your side. The more notes you lose, the more the bar swings toward your rival. Lose all your health, and the song ends with your head hung low. However, if you survive the track, hold it high, because that will win you the round.\n\nNow, if you know anything about performing in front of people, you know that a good performance is not about “surviving on stage” but about thriving. Each note in Friday Night Funkin’ has a score based on how accurately the note was held. Hit the note perfectly, and expect a “sick” score.\n\nSome songs are easier than others, so take advantage of those to rack up your scores. However, you will be rewarded generously for the more difficult songs.\n\nStrategies and Tips\nUse both hands to manage all the controls. Split the controls between left and right hands to hit simultaneous notes. Imagine dancing with only one foot. It’s not gonna win you a competition.\nFollow the patterns, and focus less on the arrows. When you need to mirror an opponent’s sequence, this will help.\nFollow the rhythm. Every song has a strong beat or melody. Let the rhythm guide your timing instead of relying only on visuals.\nPractice in Free Play. This is a lifesaver when it comes to more difficult songs. Practice them at a lower difficulty to master them.\nFriday Night Funkin’ Music\n\nComposed by Kawai Sprite, Friday Night Funkin’s soundtrack will have you moving and grooving in your swivel chair from the get-go. Each week brings a distinct style of music from funky hip-hop to spooky organ synths, electro-pop club beats, and even militaristic chiptune rock. This is a crash course in funk.\n\nYou may be familiar with a few of the tracks, like “M.I.L.F” and “Ugh” that became a viral sensation online.\n\nOngoing Development\n\nFNF is an open-source game with an active development community and plenty of fan-made mods that expand the gameplay. In addition to mods made by avid fans, the developers recently added week 7 to the game and plan on turning it into a 'full-ass game' at some point in the future.\n\nFriday Night Funkin is not available on mobile devices yet, but it will be at some point in the future since the Kickstarter got funded! This version of the game is open-source on GitHub and available under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nRhythm games are great fun to play solo or with your friends.

Whether you choose free-for-all or team deathmatch, your goal is to survive and dominate. You will need to customize your arsenal, up your game plan, and outpace your rivals in every fight. It's non-stop action for the start.\n\nHow to Play Fragen\n\nIn Fragen, you take on the role of a soldier in full combat gear, ready to fight your way through an abandoned complex filled with enemies. As you roam, you’ll face shooters everywhere, so stay alert. Switch between close-range and long-range guns depending on your position, and always keep an eye both ahead and over your shoulder.\n\nStart by choosing either a solo or team battle, then pick your mode. Solo battle options include free-for-all, sniper only, or secondary weapon only. Team battle offers modes like team deathmatch, gun race, sniper only, and secondary only.\n\nThe game features a battle pass where you can earn skins, gear upgrades, and exclusive rewards.

You'll understand the concept if you're familiar with the Bodycam game. Enter the battlefield and enjoy a unique gaming experience! BodyCamera Shooter offers ultra-realistic first-person shooter action directly in your browser and on your phone.\n\nHow to Play BodyCamera Shooter\n\nThe goal of a BodyCamera Shooter is to stay alive by neutralizing threats and surviving waves of enemies in unfamiliar territory. The emphasis is often on tactical decision-making, realism, and immersion, with a strong focus on precision and careful movement. You must navigate through environments, often with limited resources and visual awareness, to complete these objectives while maintaining your own survival.\n\nThe key to this game is combined reaction time and precision. There are numerous moves to make, and uncertainty greatly outweighs tactical precision, forcing you to adapt and react quickly to unpredictable situations. WASD or arrow keys will navigate your player, but your strength lies in using your keypad or mouse to aim and shoot.\n\nFocus on mastering movement while aiming and shooting at first. You'll likely get killed while practicing this, but it is hard to move on to more skillful moves until this is down pat.\n\nOnce you gain a bit of momentum, incorporate a bit of running (shift key) and jumping (space bar) to avoid enemy fire and navigate your surroundings more quickly.\n\nThe R key will be vital once you master your craft; it will reload your weapon quickly. Use this when surrounded by enemy fire to avoid wasting time with automatic reloads.\n\nYou can upgrade your soldier through six different levels, each corresponding to a new weapon that will be unlocked as you progress through the levels.\n\nThere are four different scenarios for the combat: the first two will be available immediately, while to access the Counter-Strike looking map, you will have to reach level 5, and the last one will only be accessible after reaching level 10.\n\nFPS perspective\n\nGame graphics are hyper-realistic and will get your adrenaline pumped. The gameplay is sometimes so real that you question whether the graphics were based on realistic scenarios and scenery.\n\nThe bodycam is positioned at chest level, providing a more realistic field of view, although it is still relatively limited due to the nature of your environment. You can use surrounding sounds as guidance, but you’re more likely to hear your footsteps than your opponents. The fish-eye view is a remarkable feature of this game, and adapting to it will be a key to the success you’ll achieve in this game.\n\nFeatures\nRealistic controls and graphics\nJuicy effects\nA variety of weapons\nWell-developed levels\nLeaderboard\nDynamic gameplay\nSmooth animations\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many exciting FPS and shooting games to check out! Krunker offers fast-paced action with various maps and modes. DEADSHOT.io challenges your aim and reflexes in a fierce online arena for even more intensity.\n\nTry a different kind of shooting experience with Bubble Shooter or Idle Breakout.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJuly 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 13, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = move\nShift = run\nSpace = jump\nC = sit down\nLeft-click = shoot\nRight-click = aim\nR = reload\n1, 2, 3 / mouse wheel = switch weapon\nTab = pause\nFAQ\nIs Bodycamera Shooter single player?\n\nBodycamera Shooter is a single-player game, played against computer opponent.\n\nCan you play Bodycamera Shooter on PC?\n\nYou can play Bodycamera Shooter online at CrazyGames in your browser.\n\nGameplay Video"

As the city falls into chaos, your mission is to uncover the cause of the apocalypse and fight to survive. Upgrade your weapons, buy new guns, and improve your skills to increase your chances. Play through different modes like sniper missions, survival challenges, and resource exploration. Dive into the intense horror of this post-apocalyptic world and battle to stay alive!\n\nHow to Play Death City: Zombie Invasion\n\nYou and your small crew have reached the bitter end—the zombie apocalypse is here, and survival is your only option. Huddled around a flickering fire, you plan your attack, surrounded by hordes of undead in a brutal, kill-or-be-killed world.\n\nZombies are everywhere, easily spotted by their eerie blue forms, and you’ll be fighting them on a full 360-degree battlefield. Keep your head on a swivel—while you're battling enemies in front, they can sneak up from behind. If you take too many hits, it’s game over, and you’ll know you’re in trouble when the red glow around you starts closing in.\n\nFollow the arrows and prompts—they’ll lead you to the essential resources you need to stay alive. But your biggest enemy? Reloading time. Those critical moments can leave you vulnerable to swarms of zombies, so make every shot count.\n\nIt’s you and a few brave souls against a world overrun by zombies. From a bird’s-eye view, you’ll see the cities you need to reclaim on your road to freedom. Prepare for intense missions in terrifying places like End of the World, Rush Time, Out of Inferno, Forest Danger, and Be Full of Peril. Each location will push you to the brink, with unique challenges and different characters to play.\n\nLucky Spin\n\nTake your chances with the Lucky Spin wheel to snag crucial resources like DNA, medicine, coins, and diamonds. But don’t get too greedy—you’ll need to watch ads if you over-spin, and there’s a cooldown period to keep things balanced.\n\nUpgrades\n\nArm yourself for the battle of your life by upgrading to powerful assault rifles, grenades, and faster-firing weapons. Pay close attention to your weapon’s stats—damage, speed, reload time, and accuracy—because as you dive deeper into the chaos, every advantage counts.\n\nWith danger lurking at every turn, it's up to you to upgrade, strategize, and fight your way through hordes of the undead. Will you conquer the apocalypse, or will the zombies claim your last breath?\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant a bit more fright to your night?

Your mission is to track and hunt various wild animals, including bears, crocodiles, deer, buffalo, and wolves. With 100 challenging levels set across three distinct game worlds such as dense forests, icy tundras, and arid deserts, you'll experience a variety of environments that test your skills and strategy.\n\nHow to Play Wild Hunter 3D\n\nStep into the wild and take on the role of a skilled hunter. Each hunt presents different animals to track and shoot, but the rugged landscape makes them difficult to spot. Staying alert is key, as the terrain provides plenty of cover for your targets.\n\nYour hunting goals appear in the top-left corner, showing how many deer, boars, or other animals you need to hunt. Completing these objectives earns reward points, and after each successful shot, you’ll see a distance meter displaying how far you were from the target. You can move around to find a better position, but the most rewarding shots come from a distance.\n\nPrecision is everything. If you miss, the animal will be startled and run, making it much harder to hit. Moving targets requires skill, and a poorly timed shot could turn the hunt against you. If an animal becomes aware of your presence, it might charge, and a wild boar stampede could end the round instantly.\n\nTo improve your aim, you can adjust both general sensitivity and scope sensitivity. Moving closer may give you an easier shot, but true hunters thrive on long-range accuracy. Survive 100 rounds, master the wild, and prove yourself as the ultimate hunter.\n\nSharpen your aim, manage your resources, and prepare for the thrill of the hunt in Wild Hunter 3D!\n\nFeatures\nRewards for successful hunts to enhance your gameplay.\nA selection of 5 weapon types is available in the in-game store.\nRealistic animal behaviors, such as fear and escape.\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our vast selection of shooting games, including Squirrel With a Gun, a quirky arcade shooting where you take on the role of a checkered squirrel armed with awesome weaponry and acrobatic moves; choose your character and fight in pixelated FPS showdowns Pixel Gun 3D; or Hazmob FPS Online Shooter, a multiplayer shooting FPS game where every second counts.

You’ll battle through dynamic levels using fluid combat and fast reflexes. Choose between endless more or level-based missions and test how long you can survive in this intense, stick-figure showdown. Made by Neron's Brother, Creators of Supreme Duelist.\n\nHow to Play Stickman Project\n\nStickman Project is a ragdoll physics-based action game, which means you’ll never have complete control over your character’s movements. That’s part of the fun; every battle is unpredictable. The game combines fluid combat, tricky level layouts, and a variety of weapons, challenging you to push through each stage and reach the next.\n\nThe first few levels are simple and serve as a good opportunity to get used to your character’s movement. You’ll encounter obstacles that require you to use the jump control repeatedly and persist until you clear them.\n\nAs you face enemies, you can fight barehanded with kicks, but weapons give you a significant advantage. Learn to pick them up quickly, and watch out for bats, swords, shields, dynamite, and potions that boost your size and power.\n\nAt the end of each round, you’ll need to project yourself into an elevator to get to the next round, but it won’t open until you’ve defeated every enemy on the level. If it stays closed, search for any opponents you might have missed.\n\nEach round becomes progressively more complex, with more dangerous enemies and trickier environments. Master your movement, collect weapons, and adapt to the chaos to survive.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more action? Browse our action collection for even more fun!

No two gameplays are alike. Find yourself with an outrageous arsenal and behind the wheel of hundreds of vehicles, all with the ultimate mission of rising through the ranks to become a top gangster. It won't be that easy, as you will have rivals to eliminate as you establish your criminal empire.\n\nHow to Play Gangster Crimes Online 6: Mafia City\n\nThis open-world mission-based game will keep you entertained as you explore the city on foot or by car, looking for new missions that may or may not be around every corner. You begin the game by leaving your lush grounds and dressing in the most inconspicuous outfits, such as jeans, cowboy boots, and tracksuit top. After all, you're dressed to dominate, not to impress.\n\nYour first \"mission\" is to follow the location icon and go through the doors out onto the street. Once there, you can literally choose from hundreds of potential scenarios. Though the easiest scenario is to jump into the car right in front of your home using the F key to enter. Not ready to hit the road, use the K key to have a dance. So much for inconspicuous!\n\nSpend some time getting used to the controls and the 360 panoramic views, and you'll learn just how indestructible (or destructible) you are. You can go into any car you like on the road. So don't worry if you missed your ride early on.\n\nDrive into the green light\n\nYour missions can be found in the green vertical laser lights. Don't drive past them; sit in them and press start. This will set the timer and the music so you can find as many green arches as possible along the city roads. You will get an arrow in the sky guiding you to them, so follow them for a straighter path.\n\nKeep chasing new missions via the vertical green lights to continue accessing rewards for upgrades and explore the city in depth. Remember, your goal is establishing an empire, so upgrades are key.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more action games to keep the excitement going!

Your main task is strategically dominating the battlefield to constantly upgrade your army and conquer enemies in an epic 1v1 battle. Lead your army to victory in this strategic game and show your earned skills to the modern world.\n\nThe old Flash game from 2007, Age of War, by Max Game Studios, has clearly been a source of inspiration for Age of Tanks Warriors.\n\nHow to Play Age of Tanks Warriors: TD War\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors is a one-click battle game, so the actual combat portion of the game is fairly simple. The difficulty lies in devising a strategy for utilizing your army and weapons to eliminate your opponents before they can eliminate you and destroy your fortress. Once you do this, you get to upgrade your army and weapons for an even more effective strategy.\n\nThe game begins with your stone cave, which is directly opposite your opponent's cave. You can deploy your soldiers by clicking the small icon on the bottom right of your screen. The only hitch is that you may not have enough soldiers to send out in time to match your opponent's troops!\n\nYour task on each level is to defeat the opposing army and destroy their shelter. As the levels advance, so do the fortresses, making it even more difficult throughout the ages. Fighting begins with sticks and stones, but eventually turns into tanks and artillery.\n\nTips\n\nCollect as many coins and as much food as possible by watching some of the ads. This will help strengthen your troop. Otherwise, it's a bit difficult, as the opponent starts with an advantage.\n\nDon't deploy too many troops straight away. It's best to deploy when the enemy is closer to home territory.\n\nYou can defeat multiple enemies with one of your soldiers, so be skillful in how many you send out simultaneously and which ones.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of battle games, browse our vast selection of popular titles.\n\nAdditional titles that require strategic thinking include Bubble Shooter and 2048.\n\nRelease Date\nFebruary 2024 (Android)\nApril 2024 (iOS)\nApril 2024 (WebGL)\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\nLast Updated\n\nJun 10, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact with the game UI.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the age of war military game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War game is an action tower defense battle game in which you fight your opponent to death throughout the ages.\n\nIs Age of Tanks Warriors a good game?\n\nAge of Tanks Warriors: The TD War is one of the more popular action titles.

Upgrade your troops, build powerful bases, and use unique units and tactics to defeat your enemies. Master every era, outsmart your opponents, and rise to become the ultimate commander in this epic war game.\n\nHow to Play TimeWarriors\n\nIn TimeWarriors, your mission is to lead an evolving army through the ages, starting from the Stone Age. Your ability to deploy troops is directly tied to your food supply. For every three pieces of food, you can send out one soldier. This means you’ll need to manage your rations: stockpiling food carefully is your priority. At the start of the game, resources are scarce, but watching ads can give you a helpful boost, allowing you to send out more soldiers and gain an early advantage.\n\nThe key to winning battles is timing and strategy. Deploy your troops when you have enough food, overwhelming your opponent before they can strengthen their defenses. Early levels allow you to outpace your enemies by cutting off their stronger units, such as soldiers on horseback, before they even have a chance to leave their base. This tactic works particularly well in Level 1, where the enemy wields essential clubs in the Stone Age.\n\nAn example of soldier deployment is based on food at level 1:\n\n1-2 pieces of food: No troops can be sent.\n3 pieces of food: Deploy one soldier.\n6 pieces of food: Deploy two soldiers, and so on.\n\nAs you progress into Level 2, the game shifts into the Farm Age, where your foes are equipped with shovels and better weaponry. To keep up, you’ll need to use the rewards you’ve earned to upgrade your army. Invest in advanced tools and weapons that match the technology of the age, but balance this with maintaining a steady flow of soldiers to ensure you’re not overwhelmed. The longer battles progress, the more critical it becomes to upgrade your troops and your base to increase food production and withstand enemy attacks.\n\nSeveral upgrades can give you a significant edge in battle. A grindstone sharpens your soldiers’ weapons, allowing them to inflict more damage, while a war banner rallies your troops to fight harder as a unified force. You can also invest in faster food production to deploy soldiers at a quicker pace or increase your base health to hold out against enemy assaults.\n\nVictory in TimeWarriors depends on finding the perfect balance between attacking, defending, and resource management. With each successful battle, you’ll move closer to mastering the game’s historical ages. From the Stone Age(70,000–20,000 BC), where tools and settlements were in their infancy, to the Farm Age (12,000–4,000 BC), where agriculture and domestication laid the foundation for civilizations, every level challenges you to adapt and evolve. Lead your army wisely, and you’ll rewrite history with your conquests!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere's no reason to stop here.

To get past round 1 and all rounds, your objective must focus on destroying your enemy's base and not just individual soldiers. Deploy as many troops as possible straight to your enemy base before they even get a chance to approach yours.\n\nGameplay Video"

The concept of the game is that the four characters are escaping a dangerous situation, which might be a falling aeroplane, where you need to be the first to get to the parachute, but only the first one reaching the goal will be saved. So it’s fair to use all of the available resources to prevent the others from advancing, while keeping the focus on being fast and efficient in your moves.

Gameplay dynamics are limited to left and right ragdoll-like jumps, making it difficult to race to the finish. You will soon see that jumping left or right creates quite a chaotic scene! The degree to which you move depends on how long you hold in either direction.\n\nAnything goes\n\nThere are multiple rounds in the race, each taking place in a different location.

Fight in Arena\n\nIn Epic Sword Battle! Fight in Arena, you immediately step into the chaos of the arena armed with a sword in each hand. The only catch is you’re working with ragdoll movements, so you never have complete control of where your sword lands! Quick reactions and accurate strikes are key. Your goal is simple.

Focus on taking them down one at a time, as fighting both simultaneously is risky. At level 4, speed is critical. The floor will rise and fall beneath your feet, and the shaky foundation means you can fall to your death before an opponent even reaches you. In level 6, lure enemies into the deadly rotating swords for an easy win, but be careful not to stumble into them yourself.\n\nFight Smart\n\nVictory depends on timing, precision, and adapting to the unpredictable environment. Strike fast, dodge attacks, and use the arena hazards to your advantage. The faster and more accurately you fight, the closer you’ll get to becoming the ultimate sword master and arena champion.\n\nEngage in epic battle against your enemies! Fight in the arena with your sword, block incoming attacks, and win ragdoll battles to become a true arena legend.

In this post-apocalyptic scenario, your mission is to defend cities across the globe by strategically placing soldiers with different weapons, each offering unique stats like damage, shooting speed, and reload speed.\n\nHow to Play World Z Defense\n\nThe world is in chaos, and only you can save it. World Z Defense puts you on the front line of a global zombie outbreak, and it’s up to you to save humanity. No pressure. You will start at an ammunition base, where you can recharge your ammunition and prepare for the relentless zombie onslaught. Zombies may be slow, but they’re persistent and will stop at nothing to break through your defenses.\n\nTo defend yourself, click, drag, and drop your character to aim at approaching zombies. Once you’ve aimed, your position is locked, and all your bullets fire in the chosen direction until you return to the ammunition base. Timing is everything—your ability to take down multiple zombies at once depends on careful planning and aim.\n\nAs you play, you’ll earn rewards that allow you to upgrade your character, improving crucial stats like reload time and firepower. These upgrades become essential as the hordes grow larger and faster, leaving you less time to react. If zombies break through your barricade, it’s game over—so don’t let your guard down.\n\nExplore a map filled with different geographical areas, each teeming with zombies waiting to be defeated. Your strategy is key: try to line up as many zombies as possible in your line of fire, as you can only shoot in one direction when away from the ammunition base. Use your resources wisely to become a more potent fighter and save the world from the undead menace. You've got this!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWhy stop the excitement here?

These coins can be used to unlock a variety of weapons, character skins, and upgrades, allowing you to customize and enhance your arsenal.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to work with your team to eliminate 100 enemy characters first, securing victory and bragging rights in this intense, action-packed competition.\n\nHow to find your enemy\n\nIt's key to use the floor plan map in the top corner of the game, which shows you exactly where your opponents are hiding and, more importantly, where your allies are as well. You want to be strategic about where your support is needed and avoid shooting friendly fire. Coordinate your moves based on where you won't be ambushed, where you can help your team, and where you have the most chance to shoot your opponents.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more adrenaline-packed action games?

Shoot, loot and commit all sorts of mischievous actions to climb the mafia ladder!\n\nHow to Play Mad Town Andreas: Mafia Storie\n\nThe story begins with your character awakening after a terrible night, of which he doesn't remember much. Your first objective will be to discover what happened while running small crime jobs for a friend named Joe. Build up your reputation as a bad guy by running or driving through the large city and making as much money as possible by completing different objectives.\n\nYou start as a nobody and will have to figure out the most efficient way to earn credit within the ranks of the local mafia. Do you want to be ruthless and commit atrocious crimes or keep it simple, drive a stolen car and undertake protection rackets?\n\nThe map on the top left of the screen will help you find the spots in downtown that lead you to completing your tasks: these are marked by a yellow circle, both on the map and on the playing field. Each completed task earns you some cash and enables you to build up your status. Be careful: as soon as you commit a crime, the police will reach you and try to take you down!\n\nThe story of the mafia in this city is also interesting: you can vie for position against other criminal masterminds and try to take them down if you wish, or align with the ruling mob and try to get into it. As you progress, you will find your own path and make your own choices in this open world. You will have endless amounts of fun as the longevity of this game is fantastic.\n\nThe cityscape will help you feel immersed in the game as you drive and complete your tasks.

Your mission is to evolve your character into an unstoppable force by unlocking powerful upgrades, mastering epic combos, and unleashing devastating fatalities that will destroy your foes. Conquer waves of enemies with precision and skill as you dominate each battle. Only after crushing every opponent will you unlock the portal to the next level, where even more significant challenges await. Sharpen your reflexes, perfect your strategies, and prove you have what it takes.\n\nHow to Play Stick Epic Fighter\n\nYou begin in a classic arcade-style side-scrolling screen, where you’ll quickly get accustomed to the game’s controls. Use the up arrow to jump, the down arrow to attack, and the left and right arrows for movement. Before long, you’ll encounter enemies—attack them by holding the down arrow to unleash a series of sword strikes. Holding down the attack key continuously lets you deliver multiple hits, which is essential since enemies require several strikes to be defeated.\n\nThough you can jump and sprint past enemies to reach the end of the level quickly, you won’t be able to progress to the next round until all foes are eliminated. If you leave any behind, you’ll have to backtrack and take them out. Once every enemy is defeated, and you reach the final portal, your stickman will celebrate with a happy dance, signaling that you’ve successfully cleared the level!\n\nAs you advance, the difficulty ramps up with more enemies and tougher challenges, so stay alert and fast on your feet! Use the arrows for guidance on enemy locations and areas you may have missed. Throughout the course, prompts will also direct you to jump to high platforms or descend into lower areas.\n\nEach round rewards you with points that can be used to purchase upgrades, boosting your power and making it easier to defeat stronger enemies. Plus, you can customize your stickman by changing skins, giving your hero a fresh look as you fight your way through each increasingly intense round!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nKeep the fun coming.

It’s designed to provide a challenging and adrenaline-filled experience for players who thrive on competition and enjoy mastering their skills. This game promises a dynamic gameplay experience that blends skill progression, tactical combat, and exciting visuals, making it a must-play for fans of action games.\n\nHow to Play Archer's Arena\n\nIn Archer's Arena, precision is key as you face off in intense, one-on-one battles where you’ll carefully track your vitals like health, base damage, and headshot damage. The gameplay is simple yet challenging: hold the left mouse button to aim and release to shoot, but your movement is limited, you can only adjust your bow’s angle up and down, never your character's position.\n\nAccuracy is paramount, with some rounds offering helpful guidance on where to aim. Each player takes a shot in turn, with the round continuing until one player runs out of energy. While taking a hit won’t cost you your life, running out of energy will cost you the round.\n\nAs you progress through multi-level challenges, you’ll need to prove your accuracy and adaptability, navigating diverse heights, angles, and obstacles. Upgrading your hero and arsenal will be crucial, unlocking new abilities and weapons as you gain experience points.\n\nPrepare to face off against skilled opponents with ever-evolving strategies, testing your skill and creativity.

You will get to challenge players from around the world, so be prepared for plenty of surprises and a variety of strategies from your opponent.\n\nHow to Play Tanks Arena io: Craft & Combat\n\nYour goal in Tanks Arena.io: Craft & Combat is pretty much to destroy or be destroyed. The sky's the limit in terms of creativity and tactical prowess as you determine what kind of vehicle you will use to destroy your enemy. Start by building your ultimate battle machine. Pick from a variety of chassis, turrets, armor plating, and weapons to craft a tank that reflects your unique style—or even emulate legendary tanks like the T-34 or Leviathan. Once you've built your tank, the real action begins.\n\nYour first challenge is against Tobi the Tower, a rookie opponent to help you get a feel for the battlefield. Earn rewards like coins, jewels, and new tank parts as you progress, which can be used to unlock upgrades and make your tank even mightier.\n\nAs you climb the ranks, you’ll face tougher opponents like Frank the Mole, each with their own strategies and strengths—some tanks are much bigger than you, but it's not the size that counts. Outmaneuver them by targeting their weak spots—aim for their wheels to disable their movement or flip their vehicle to expose vulnerable areas.\n\nThe key to victory is constant improvement. Keep upgrading your weapons, armor, and gadgets to stay ahead. A stronger tank means better odds of winning battles and dominating the arena.\n\nProve your skills by crushing opponents in the championships and advance to the prestigious Bronze Division. With each victory, you’ll climb the leaderboard, earning bragging rights and unlocking more rewards.\n\nStrategic hits can turn the tide of battle.

Each puzzle brings about new furnishings and upgrades to keep you hooked. You have options, so redesign rooms with your style choices, swap out furniture, and watch your estate transform from rags to riches.\n\nHow to Play Open House\n\nYou, Oscar, are fresh off a rough flight, and things couldn’t have started worse. Somewhere during the trip, all your belongings fell out of the plane. You beg Theo, the pilot who took you to this island, to turn back so you can find them, but he refuses, saying he has too many passengers. He takes off without you.\n\nTrying to stay positive, you decide this might be the perfect chance to start over in your new beachside home. After all, it’s only a suitcase… and luckily, you were wearing your favorite shirt during the flight. Time to see your new place.\n\nYou greet your neighbor, who’s not exactly welcoming, then head toward your new home only to find it looks nothing like the pictures from the real estate listing. The porch is falling apart, the rooms are wrecked, and it’s clear today is not your day. You can’t help but wonder if you’re on some sort of prank show.\n\nYour first quest is to remove all the covers from the furniture in hopes of finding a hidden camera. To do this, you’ll complete match-3 puzzles that appear on the screen. Each match earns points and helps you move forward.\n\nAs you work, you notice the place is so bad that it even has critters running around. It’s time to contact the real estate agency. You're sitting at your computer when the desk collapses. You’ll need to replace both the desk and the chair before you can write to Mr. Fraudley, the man who sold you this disaster of a house. You send him a message explaining the mess, and he blocks you immediately.\n\nJust when you’re feeling hopeless, your neighbor Charles surprises you by finding your missing suitcases, but the purple flower, which means a lot to you, is still missing. He advises you to get a wardrobe to store your clothes. After that, you’ll need a good night’s rest, which means buying a new bed.\n\nBetween each home repair or furniture purchase, you’ll play match-3 puzzles to earn what you need. Every successful round brings you closer to fixing up the house.\n\nYou keep trying to leave the island, but something always stops you. In the meantime, you keep decorating, cleaning, and repairing. Over time, you might just discover that this wrecked beach house has the potential to become the dream home you never knew you wanted.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Open House, browse our match-3 games for more fun. There is also plenty of variation in our puzzle category, with games like Word Search and 2048.\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to play and interact with all the in-game buttons.\n\nFAQ\nHow do you upgrade furniture in Open House?\n\nYou can clean up your dream home gone wrong in Open House by playing match-3 rounds to earn enough to get new home furnishings.\n\nIs Open House a mobile friendly game?\n\nOpen House is a mobile-friendly game, so you can decorate and play match-3 puzzles on the go.\n\nGameplay Video"

There are no shuffles, and the game is timed, but the game's pace is relaxed.\n\nHow to Play Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nSpot the patterns\n\nMahjong is a tricky puzzle game. There are so many tiles, many of which look the same but feature slight differences. Along with the need to spot these patterns, you can’t move any pieces with both sides blocked. The left or right side needs to be accessible, at least.\n\nFinding a couple of “free” tiles is the challenge here, with a tile-free being when there are no tiles on top of it. In addition, either its left or right side needs to be open. In this version of Mahjong Solitaire, you can look at the top of your screen to understand how many pairs of tiles are “free” to be matched, plus you can match the special tiles, those with a colored background, anytime.\n\nUse hints when you’re stuck\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features hints if you get stuck, but unlike some other mahjong games, it does not have a shuffle feature. The games are also timed, meaning there is some urgency to how many tiles you can match.\n\nWhen the game ends, you’ll get a score for the tiles you matched and a bonus for how far you got in the game before your time ran out.\n\nTile groups in Mahjongg Solitaire\n\nMahjongg Solitaire features 144 tiles divided primarily into three suits. The primary suits are:\n\nDots - feature circles\nBamboo - feature lines\nCharacters - feature Chinese characters\n\nIn Mahjongg Solitaire, you’ll also notice special tiles that can be matched even without the same image. These are highlighted in blue or green.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nMahjong Solitaire is an excellent choice for both beginners and regular Mahjong enthusiasts. However, there are many other titles in our collection of Mahjong games. Other puzzle games you may like include board games such as 2048, Rummikub, and Ludo.\n\nRelease Date\n\nOctober 2016\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile). We also have the Android version.\n\nLast Updated\n\nAug 03, 2022\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to interact.\n\nFAQ\nIs it spelled mahjong or mahjongg?\nBoth words are correct and are used to describe the same game.\nIs Mahjongg Solitaire a difficult game?\nMahjong is generally a tricky game, but this is probably a medium-difficulty mahjong game compared with others. There are no shuffles, but you have 10 minutes and unlimited hints which balances the game nicely.\nIs Mahjong Solitaire a free game?\n\nYes, you can play Mahjong Solitaire online for free at CrazyGames.\n\nIs Mahjong good for the brain?\n\nPuzzle games are often cited as keeping the mind sharp and maintaining brain health.\n\nGameplay Video"

Challenge yourself by outsmarting opponents of various skill levels to strengthen yours. If you prefer to play solo, level up your abilities against the computer, choosing from a range of difficulty settings—from beginner to World Champion. Whether you're just learning the game or aiming for grandmaster status, interactive hints help refine your moves to get you there.\n\nHow to Play Chess Free\n\nChess Free follows the classic rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.\n\nYou can play against the computer, compete online with real players, or share the same screen with a friend. With 18 difficulty levels ranging from Beginner to World Champion, you can play based on your level.\n\nDepending on your level, you can choose a \"handicap,\" so you have a bit of an advantage. You can also enable hints and interactive tips to help guide you throughout.\n\nThe rules are basic—players take turns moving their pieces. Pawns move forward but capture diagonally, knights move in an L-shape, and other pieces have unique movement patterns. Strategy is key in chess. Protect your pieces, control the center of the board, and anticipate your opponent's moves. The game ends when one player's king is checkmated, resulting in a win or if a draw occurs under certain conditions.\n\nIn chess, a draw is a result where neither player wins, and the game ends in a tie. This can happen for several reasons, such as stalemate (where a player has no legal moves but is not in check), repetition of the same position three times, 50 moves without a capture or pawn move, insufficient material to checkmate, or mutual agreement between the players.\n\nMade a mistake?\n\nNo problem—use the move cancel feature to undo and rethink your strategy. After each match, detailed analysis highlights errors and suggests better moves, while the option to replay specific moments helps reinforce learning.\n\nYou can save your rating and pick different time control modes like bullet, blitz, and rapid. Customize the board and pieces to your liking, review your move history, and even express yourself with playful cartoon emotions as you interact with your opponent.\n\nSpecial Chess Moves to Know\n\nCastling\n\nCastling is a special chess move involving the king and a rook. It’s only allowed if neither the king nor the rook have moved previously, and there are no pieces between them. Additionally, the king cannot be in check, and it must not move through or land on any square that is under attack. This move helps protect the king and connect the rooks for better defense.\n\nTaking the pass\n\nTaking the pass, or en passant, is a special pawn capture in chess. If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward and lands next to your pawn, you can capture it on your next move as if it had only moved one square. Your pawn will take its place, but this capture must be done immediately.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you are a board game fiend, we have you covered!

Stop the dragons from reaching your castle by building your defenses through tactical tile-matching decisions.\n\nHow to Play\nBuild your defenses\n\nMatch 3 pieces of the same resource to upgrade them to a weapon or defense piece. When you have 3 of the same weapon or wall beside each other, you can merge them to create more powerful units. However, merging also means less coverage over the map, so sometimes you should delay the decision to merge.\n\nProtect your castle\n\nYou have a limited number of swaps available before the dragons attack, so you have to use them wisely. Position your defenses so you can weather the attack! Before the boss round the game will show an arrow indicating the area where the drag will appear. Day 10 and day 20 are the first boss dragon levels, so you need to be prepared. Once you kill a boss, they release a large number of smaller dragons.\n\nCombine resources\n\nCombine 3 of these resources to build the following defenses:\n\nStone - creates a defensive attack tower\nGunpowder - builds a cannon\nIce - creates an ice wall\nLogs - creates an attack turret\nGold - forms a chest containing swaps and sometimes other items like TNT and anvils to immediately upgrade resources.\n\nAll of the created defenses above can then be merged again to build an even more powerful unit.\n\nSign up and join a clan\n\nIt's worth signing up for an account in Tower Swap! It is a simple process and will allow you to build a custom avatar using extensive options, join a clan to compete, earn gold, and unlock chests with rewards. At the end of each game you'll receive gold coins that you can use to buy lives and open chests early.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nTower Swap is a unique game that combines elements from match-3 games and tower defense games.

Together, Fiona and Aiden gather timber and merge logs to create essential tools and craft materials, unlocking treasure chests filled with valuable rewards to continue on her quest.\n\nEvery decision you make shapes Fiona’s path, allowing her to rebuild and expand her world. What begins as a small garden evolves into a thriving medieval kingdom, complete with bustling marketplaces and grand castles. As you progress, the adventure deepens, introducing new lands teeming with hidden treasures, mysterious puzzles, and historical figures who assist in unraveling the mysteries of time and family.\n\nTo embark on this journey, start by merging three wheat sprouts to cultivate a full wheat crop, then continue merging similar items to develop the garden further. Harvest the wheat to trade for keys that unlock new areas, dispelling the fog and revealing untapped potential.

As you progress through the levels, you’ll need to clear stacks of tiles by matching three identical ones, but be careful—strategic thinking is essential to avoid getting stuck!\n\nHow to Play Piles of Mahjong\n\nPiles of Mahjong brings a fresh twist to the classic Mahjong formula with some exciting new dynamics. The game has most of the same foundational rules as a classic game of table mahjong, but instead of simply matching two tiles, your goal is to match three tiles from a pile featuring a mix of familiar patterns like circles and sticks, alongside fun new additions like bird and panda heads. To make a match, you must select tiles by clicking on them, and they’ll move to one of the seven empty spaces at the bottom of the screen.\n\nBut be careful! If you fill all seven spaces without making any triple matches, it’s game over. Strategic thinking is essential to clear the pile and avoid running out of space.\n\nThe game offers helpful features to assist you when you’re stuck, but they come with a price. You can reshuffle the tiles with 300 reward points or by watching an ad, flip all the tiles face up for the same cost, or even auto-match tiles in the bottom row with 100 reward points or an ad.\n\nTo add to the challenge, you start with two chances to remove a tile from the bottom area. Once those chances are used up, you will need to spend 100 reward points or watch an ad to earn another set of removals.

Inspired by classic mahjong, Onet Connect takes a fresh approach to pairing games. Each mode comes with the same rules but provides a different visual twist, so you can switch up the theme while honing your skills.\n\nYou can match tiles that are side by side, and initially, you will have to do to begin making a bit of board space. Once you have some of the board clear, you can match any tiles that may not be side by side but instead have blank space between the two.\n\nQuick thinking is essential, especially because there is a ticking clock breathing down your neck—but don’t worry—there’s a hint option to lend a hand if you get stuck!\n\nIf you’re new to Onet Connect or need a refresher on how the pieces link, simply hit pause and click the question mark icon.

These shuffles let you rearrange the board when you’re struggling to find matches, opening up new possibilities. Plus, you have access to three hints, each one showing two connectable pieces to help you out of tough spots. Use them wisely—they’re free but limited!\n\nThe levels in Onet Connect gradually increase in difficulty, testing both your speed and your strategy. As you progress, you’ll be challenged to match faster, spot connections more efficiently, and use your shuffles and hints more strategically. It’s the ultimate test of your concentration and quick reflexes, inviting you to keep improving and setting high scores.

You'll start by testing your skills in simple situations: snatching a purse from an old woman seated on a bench or grabbing groceries from two unsuspecting women from a ledge. As you progress, the challenges escalate. You’ll even swipe a tourist’s suitcase while they admire the Eiffel Tower and outwit a rival thief to steal a money bag in a museum. There’s never a dull moment as you navigate your way through each clever scenario.\n\nFrom beachside schemes where you steal a pearl from a shell to slipping into restricted areas by pickpocketing a key, every level brings new surprises. As the difficulty increases, you’ll find yourself pulling off trickier moves like swiping a diamond ring from a newly engaged couple while they’re lost in a kiss or lifting answers from a classmate’s test without getting caught by whirling fans. You’ll also have to outsmart guard dogs to steal car keys, drive away with precision, avoid TNT explosions, and—just for fun—snatch a toupee from the head of a party guest.\n\nAs the levels progress, you will need increasing sharp thinking and precise timing as you carefully plot your moves to avoid detection and snatch the prize. With every stage growing more challenging, you'll need to outwit elaborate defenses using clever strategies and creative solutions.\n\nSharp thinking alone won't cut it. You will need to calculate the perfect angles and find the shortest path to avoid detection. The puzzles are designed to challenge your wit and timing, requiring you to navigate obstacles and interact with dynamic environments. The slightest misstep could alert your target or trigger traps, so precision is key as you outmaneuver everything from dogs, furniture, and, of course, unsuspecting victims.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant a few more brain-teasing games to get you scratching your head?

Each level presents a new challenge that requires patience, logic, and careful planning to succeed. Be vigilant! The number of additional holes is limited, so you'll need to think a few steps ahead before making a move. Every action counts, and rushing in without a plan could leave you stuck! Once all the bolts are sorted correctly, you’ll complete the level and move on to even trickier puzzles. Can you master every challenge and become the ultimate bolt-sorting expert?\n\nHow to Play Screw Out: Bolts and Nuts\n\nYour main goal in Screw Out: Bolts and Nuts is to fill all the screw containers at the top but be careful: if the extra (unmatched) screw slots fill up completely, you’ll lose the round.\n\nAt the top of the screen, you have a set of empty screw holders, each with a specific color. Below, you'll see various shapes secured by colored screws. Your task is to unscrew each shape strategically, so that when all its screws are removed, the shape falls away.\n\nThe trick? Only unscrew screws that match the colors of the empty slots above. Any screw without a matching color gets tossed into your limited \"extra\" container space. If that space fills up, and you try to unscrew more with no room left, it’s game over.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nAlways have a place to put your screws.\nMatch screw colors to top containers whenever possible.\nOnce a container is fully filled, it refreshes with a new color, giving you more room to play, so try to fill them quickly.\n\nSpecial Tools & Power-Ups:\n\nMagnet – Instantly fills one container (1,500 points)\nDrill – Adds one additional hole (1,200 points)\nHammer – Breaks and removes an entire shape (1,800 points)\nSkip Level – Skip to the next level (3,000 points)\n\nThis game is a true brain teaser that tests your logic, timing, and strategy. Choose your screws wisely!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWho doesn’t love a good brain teaser? Other fun puzzle titles worth a try include Candy Riddles, a puzzle game where you have to match three or more delicious treats; Zoo Boom, a puzzle match-3 game with mission-based rounds to challenge you at every level; or Trivia Crack, a fun quiz game where you can test your general knowledge and learn amazing facts about the world.\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 09, 2025\n\nControls\n\nUse the left mouse button to unscrew the bolt.\n\nFAQ\nHow many colors do I have to match in Screw Out: Bolts and Nuts?\n\nYou have to match 3 screws in Screw Out: Bolts and Nuts before you can get a new color to unscrew.\n\nCan I play Screw Out: Bolts and Nuts on mobile?\n\nScrew Out: Bolts and Nuts is available on mobile, and can be played on most devices."

With each successful sort, you'll feel a satisfying sense of accomplishment. Get ready to test your strategy and problem-solving skills as you work your way through increasingly complex and colorful challenges!\n\nHow to Play Nuts Puzzle: Sort By Color\nOrganize the nuts\n\nTo play Nuts Puzzle: Sort by Color, start by tapping on the nut you want to move, then select the screw where you want to place it. You can only place a nut on another screw if it’s either empty or if the top nut on that screw matches the color of the nut you’re moving. This simple rule sets the stage for the puzzle-solving challenge, as you’ll need to strategically plan your moves to ensure each screw ends up with nuts of a single color.\n\nAs you progress, the game introduces more nuts and a wider range of colors, making the puzzles increasingly complex. New challenges, such as hard mode levels, add an extra layer of difficulty by hiding the color of nuts until you move a piece from above them. These added twists will test your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills as you work through each level, striving to complete the puzzle with fewer moves and greater efficiency.\n\nUse helpers\n\nIt’s at this point that you may need to use the undo, reset, and extra screw options, which are available on every level. However, you can only win extra screws from chests and from the winner's wheel. Clicking the screw icon adds an extra screw to free up more space. The undo button has a finite number of uses, but these are restored on each level. You can use the reset button to start the level over from scratch if you have no choice.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you love solving puzzles, check out more titles from our puzzle selection.\n\nHave a go at some of our popular casual titles: Geometry Dash is a popular game that uses simple mechanics to help you navigate a challenging context.

You don't have a large selection of materials to work with and often use metal planks, which have limited availability. The ultimate test in your bridge build is when you press the play button and an actual vehicle crosses your design. If it gets to the other side, your bridge is a success. If instead it collapses, it's back to the drawing board for you!\n\nHow to Play Bridge Builder\n\nPut your engineering skills to the test in Bridge Builder, a game where creativity and precision decide whether your structures stand tall or crumble into the river below.\n\nEach round gives you a new challenge. Drag and drop metal pieces from the circles and extend them as far or as short as you like. Be careful, metal is costly, and you have a limited amount to work with. If you run out of metal or make a mistake, tap twice on a piece to remove it.\n\nIf you are building a bridge over water, you will need strong support on each side. Try building two Y-shaped structures with a piece of metal connecting them. The support will come from the walls; without it, the structure will collapse.\n\nAnother way to build over water is to create a Y structure in the center of the bridge’s length. It may not be the most stable design and will strain some areas, but as long as the car can safely cross, the bridge is considered a success. The challenge is to get the vehicle across without the bridge breaking.\n\nYou can also experiment with two supporting triangles on each side of the bridge for added stability.\n\nIf you have stronger cables and a bigger budget, try building upward. Some levels include vertical concrete slabs you can use for support. Bridges like this might sway slightly since they do not have a solid foundation below them, and that is normal. Go big or go home.\n\nThese are just a few examples to get you started. The options are endless, and if your structure is not sound, you will quickly find out and always get a chance to redeem yourself.\n\nYou will begin building bridges in the city. As your architecture skills improve, you will unlock new landscapes such as waterfalls, canyons, and mountain ranges.\n\nYou can request a hint at any time. Hints will ask whether you want the bridge automatically built for you or if you would like to see a guide on how to build it yourself.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like the simple dynamics of Bridge Builder, you will want to explore our puzzle category! Try number games like 2048, or word games like Word Scramble, Word Wipe, or symbol games like Mahjong Online.\n\nLast Updated\n\nSep 09, 2025\n\nControls\nDrag left click = build a bridge\nSpace = start simulation\nZ = undo\nFAQ\nIs there a Bridge Builder tutorial?\n\nThere is a Bridge Builder tutorial at the beginning of the game, and if you are stuck on any one bridge, you can get a complete tutorial of how the bridge is built from start to finish.\n\nWhat's everyone's favorite bridge building game?\n\nIt's hard to choose just one favorite game, but Bridge Builder is a common fan favorite thanks to its simplicity and physics-based builds.\n\nGameplay Video"

The only way out is to problem-solve your way to freedom by solving riddles using colors, paints, and painting tools that can be found throughout the room. Each clue will lead to the next, until finally, your colorful journey leads you to an exit.\n\nHow to Play Paint Room Escape\n\nIn Paint Room Escape, your objective is to unlock doors by solving color-based puzzles. One of the first tasks is to paint the colorless door using hints scattered throughout the room. Search for items like palettes and pencil holders and get guided into selecting the correct colors. For example, one puzzle requires painting a door with specific color patterns by observing how circles and squares are divided on a palette. As you progress, different combinations of colors help you unlock new areas and doors, with red and yellow paint being crucial early on.\n\nAs you move through the rooms, you will come across more complex puzzles. In one scenario, you must rotate color samples and match a sequence of pale blue to dark blue shades. You'll also encounter digit-based locks, like a door that requires entering a secret code to unlock.\n\nCompleting these challenges rewards you with items such as paint tubes, allowing you to progress by filling in corresponding door sections. New color clues emerge as you rinse objects in water, revealing hidden numbers and hints for further puzzles.\n\nManipulating various tools, such as temperature controls and stencils, adds even more challenging layers of complexity. At one point, you must adjust the temperature to paint the door a certain color, then adjust it once more to switch to another color.\n\nOne of the final challenges involves arranging pencils, rotating objects, and solving shape-based puzzles to activate switches and unlock the exit door. Mixing colors like blue and yellow to create green and using a screwdriver to access hidden compartments are essential steps to achieving your ultimate creative goal—escape by color!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant more puzzle game fun?

Blend colors skillfully to bring 3D objects to life, turning each into a stunning work of art. With every stroke, challenge your creativity and enjoy the satisfaction of crafting vibrant masterpieces in this immersive and artistic experience.\n\nHow to Play Color Match\n\nIn Color Match, your goal is to match the color of an object presented to you using a series of available colors. The challenge is to mix and combine different colors until you reach the correct shade that closely matches the object.\n\nYou can only move on to the next round once you've matched the color to a high percentage.

And the best part is there is no cleanup since it's all digital!\n\nHow to Play Solitr\n\nThe objective of the Solitr game is similar to that of the tabletop card version of Solitaire—you must move all your cards to the four foundation piles located in the upper right corner of the screen, leaving none on the board.\n\nThe rules are straightforward: stack each pile of cards in ascending order from King to Ace of the same suit. Once you have a complete ascending order, you can place these cards in the upper right corner. There is a hidden stockpile at the top left of the screen, which you can choose to display one or three cards, but only one will be available for movement at a time.\n\nYou will want to strategically move the uncovered stockpile card onto one of the seven tableau columns, depending on whether it can be placed in ascending order. You can drag cards to move them onto the seven tableau columns or to the four foundations. Remember that the seven columns only allow for alternating colors to be placed in ascending order.\n\nFor building rules, cards in the foundations must be stacked by the same suit in ascending order, from Ace to King. In the tableau, cards need to be stacked in alternating colors, from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Additionally, any empty spots in the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.\n\nAs the deck is shuffled in random order, you must carefully strategize to find the correct moves as you reveal cards one by one. This is the essence of the solitaire challenge.\n\nYou can move either single cards or piles of cards within the tableau, but you can only move cards from the waste pile. Whenever you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card will automatically turn face-up for you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you want to continue playing more puzzle games, we have a vast selection, including digital versions of tabletop classics. Have fun at Yahtzee Online, Uno Online, Mahjongg Solitaire, Ludo, Rummikub, and many more.

To win, you must prioritize moving cards from the tableau to the foundations whenever possible, as this opens up space for more moves and helps reveal hidden cards."

In this brain teaser, you will get to shuffle, stack, and strategize to create satisfying color matches. Featuring sleek 3D graphics, a dazzling array of vibrant hues, and soothing gameplay, this addictive challenge strikes the perfect balance between excitement and relaxation. Whether you’re seeking a mental workout or a calming escape, Hexa Sort delivers an experience that’s as rewarding as it is visually stunning.\n\nHow to Play Hexa Sort\n\nHexa Sort is a captivating and brain-teasing puzzle game that combines strategy with vibrant design. Your mission is to arrange hexagons on a 19-space board by matching their bold primary colors—blue, red, yellow, green, and more. To clear the board, you must place hexagons of the same color close together. Once aligned and unobstructed, they stack automatically with satisfying ASMR-inspired sound effects, but there’s a catch—they must match exactly. The smooth 3D graphics and vibrant palette make every move visually appealing, creating a relaxing yet immersive gameplay experience.\n\nThe real challenge lies in the hexagons’ multiple-layered colors, which add a clever layer of complexity. To reveal and match the colors underneath, you must first stack the top layers. This means strategic placement is key; you’ll need to position hexagons near similar colors to ensure cascading matches when the top layers are cleared. It’s a puzzle that requires both foresight and precision and as the stacks build up, so does the satisfaction of mastering each move.\n\nTo keep things engaging, Hexa Sort includes exciting power-ups and boosters, giving you the tools to overcome even the trickiest situations. Whether you’re a casual player or a puzzle enthusiast, the game’s combination of vibrant visuals, smooth mechanics, and rewarding challenges makes it as relaxing as it is addictive.

With levels ranging from beginner to World Champion, you'll find the perfect match for your skills. Enjoy interactive hints, undo moves, and even play with a friend on the same screen. Customize your game and improve with every move.\n\nHow to Play English Checkers Free\n\nIn this game, you have several options: you can play with the computer, play online, play with friends, or play together. The mandatory rules are simple but important. You must jump over your opponent’s checker to capture it. A simple checker moves diagonally forward by one square and can only move forward. If there’s an empty square behind your opponent’s checker, you can jump over it and land there. If you have multiple capturing opportunities, you can choose which one to take. You continue jumping until no more captures are possible.\n\nIf your checker reaches the last row, it is crowned and becomes a king. A king can move diagonally both forward and backward. When jumping, the king can capture multiple opponent’s pieces and must continue capturing as long as possible. The player must jump whenever possible, and if there are several jumping options, they can pick any of them.\n\nYou can choose your opponent and enable hints or apply a handicap, such as making captures mandatory. You can also select your side (black or white) before starting the game. There are eight difficulty levels, ranging from Beginner to World Champion, and interactive tips are provided to help you improve your gameplay. You can cancel a move and go back if needed, replay the game from any point, and interact with your opponent through funny cartoon emotions. The game can be played with real live players, and you can choose between different time control modes like unlimited, bullet, blitz, rapid, or classic.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, when a checker reaches the last row, it is crowned and can move both forward and backward. If your checker is next to your opponent’s checker and there’s an open square behind it, you must jump and capture the checker. If one jump leads to another, you continue with the next jump as part of the same turn. If your checker reaches the last row and is crowned, you cannot make further jumps during that turn. Jumping is mandatory, and if you have more than one option, you can choose which one to take. Regular checkers can only capture forward, while kings can capture both forward and backward.\n\nYou win the game by capturing all of your opponent’s checkers or by blocking your opponent completely so they cannot move.\n\nRules of the game:\nWhen a checker reaches the last row of the board, he is “kinged” or “crowned” and becomes a king. A king moves the same way as a regular checker, except he can move forward or backward.\nOn your turn, if your checker is next to your opponent’s checker, and the black square behind your opponent’s checker is open, you must jump over it and capture it. If one jump leads to another jump, you then continue with the next jump as part of the same turn. Continue in this way until all possible jumps are complete. If your checker jumps to the last row and is crowned, you may not make any further jumps, your turn is over.\nJumping is compulsory. If you have the opportunity to jump and capture an opponent’s checker, you must take it. If you have more than one capturing opportunity, you may choose whichever you prefer.\nAn ordinary checker can capture only forward. King checkers can capture both forward and backward.\nA player wins the game when they capture all of their opponent’s checkers, or when they block their opponent completely and the opponent cannot move.\nFeatures\nPowerful engine\n8 difficulty levels from Beginner to World Champion\nDisplay of possible moves when choosing a piece\nInteractive tips on how to play better during the game\nCancel the move, if there was a yawn, you can go back\nThe ability to replay the game from the right place\nInteract with the opponent through funny cartoon emotions\nReal live players\nSaving the rating\nChess together on the same screen\nSelection of time control modes: unlimited, bullet, blitz, rapid, classic\nChoose the design of the shapes and the board\nView the history of moves\nRelease Date\n\nAugust 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWho doesn’t love a good brain teaser?

It's a board game where you care for a garden that grows flowers continuously as you move them around. You are tasked with lining up 5 of the same flowers to make them disappear. If your garden gets overgrown with flowers and becomes too much to handle, you lose.\n\nHow to play Blooming Gardens\n\nAs any good gardener knows, if you have a green thumb, everything you touch grows, so you need to do some cleanup. Overgrowing your garden is exactly what will get you into trouble in Blooming Gardens. When you plant one flower, others grow, but there simply is not enough space in this garden to maintain the full array of growth.\n\nIt's time to get those green fingers working and get your garden under control. Plants grow faster than you can pick them, and the only way to clear your garden to make space is to get the same plant in rows of five or more. The more you clear in a row, the more points you get.\n\nHow to clear garden space in Blooming Gardens\n\nLine up five of the same flowers to remove them from the board. You can move flowers from one spot to the next in the garden, but only if there is a clear path for them to follow. This means you cannot move them unless the garden grid pieces are filled with other flowers to block your movement.\n\nIf your path is blocked, you will see an X on the grid pieces, which helps indicate legitimate movements.\n\nThe game ends when the board is filled with flowers, and there is no more space to grow. You will be informed what flowers will grow next. To strategize your moves, check the next flowers coming up on the right side of the screen.\n\nIt's time to get those green fingers working and your garden under control.\n\nCan you keep your garden in check and get the highest score possible? Find out with Blooming Gardens!\n\nTip\n\nIf you have four of the same flowers in a row and there's space for six, don't immediately fill the fifth slot to get six out in one move.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle games, there are plenty more to explore! Mahjongg offers a classic tile-matching challenge that tests your strategy and concentration. Sandtrix provides a unique twist on traditional puzzles. Match the Color challenges your pattern recognition and timing skills. They're not garden-specific, but they do maintain similar game dynamics.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser\n\nControls\nLeft Mouse Button = Pick up flower/Plant\nFAQ\nHow to play Blooming Gardens?\n\nBlooming Gardens is a puzzle game in which you click to grab a plant and then click a new patch to replant it.

Rotate structures, tap wisely, and remove wooden blocks to reveal intricate 3D designs. With progressively complex levels and engaging mechanics, each move requires careful planning. Hone your problem-solving skills and enjoy a satisfying puzzle experience filled with clever challenges!\n\nHow to Play Tap 3D Wood Block Away\n\nTap 3D Wood Block Away is like a virtual Jenga with a twist—only this time, the tower is smaller, the pieces come in all shapes, and everything moves in 3D!\n\nEach level presents a tangled stack of wooden blocks, some tiny, some long, some square, and your goal is to free them all. But it’s not as simple as it sounds. Every block is interlocked with others, and you can’t move one if something’s in the way. Follow the directional arrows on each piece to see where it can slide: if it’s an upward arrow but there’s a block above it, guess what? You’re stuck until you clear the path.\n\nStrategic tapping is the key: remove the surrounding blocks to make wiggle room and gradually dismantle the entire structure. Just remember: removing a block from the middle won’t collapse the rest. Every single piece has to be released to complete the level.\n\nAs you move forward, the stacks get trickier and the pressure builds. But between rounds, you can boost your score by hitting a moving arrow at just the right moment: land it and you might double, triple, or even quadruple your points.\n\nNeed a better look? Zoom in and out to scout which blocks are free and which ones are hiding in plain sight. Time to tap smart, clear the chaos, and master the puzzle.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWho doesn’t love a good brain teaser?

Start by drilling deep into the Earth’s crust, extracting valuable minerals and hidden treasures.\n\nWith each click, you’ll uncover riches that can be sold to fund the expansion and upgrading of your mining operations. As your business grows, you’ll be able to unlock new technologies and hire workers to dig even deeper, inching ever closer to the Earth’s core.\n\nHow to Play Mister Mine\n\nThe goal of the game is to mine for resources. The deeper you go, the greater the rewards. Mine deeper underground to obtain more resources and minerals to sell. You'll also encounter treasure chests the further you dig. These chests contain random rewards from small to vast amounts of money and resources.\n\nUnlike your typical idle game, Mister Mine requires active participation from players. This is evident in two ways: miners must find stones or minerals that require clicking, and players will encounter Bosses in the mines' depths that need to be fought back. You also need to monitor closely the percentage of capacity you reach. Once it’s at 100% your miners will stop working, so you’ll need to either sell all or some of your resources or use them to build or upgrade your tools.\n\nYour miners will be digging through 3 different worlds:\n\nEarth, up to 1032 km of depth\nMoon, from 1032 to 1132 km of depth\nTitan, after 1132 km of depth.\nComplete quests\n\nThere are 112 different quests to complete, each of which will give you a different reward, enabling you to improve your business further.\n\nUpgrade your gear\n\nYou start the game with a humble shovel for digging. As you earn enough currency, you can upgrade your digging methods, progressing from a shovel to a jackhammer, and then to a drill, and finally to a nuclear excavator. Beyond that point, upgrades get supernatural, replacing workers with aliens and demons!\n\nHidden gems\n\nDig until km 50 to encounter the Golem (talking to it is one of the quests!) and reach km 400 to meet the first of six Earth bosses.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our clicker games for many more addictive idle and clicker titles.\n\nOther popular games include Idle Breakout and Little Alchemy.\n\nDeveloper\n\nPlaysaurus developed Mr. Mine.\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nSteam\nAndroid\nControls\n\nLeft mouse button\n\nFAQ\nHow do I get tickets in Mr. Mine?\n\nYou can get tickets from the following places:\n\nCaves (x1)\nQuests\nTrading (x1, x2)\nGold treasure chests\nExcavations\nDonating\nHow can I get building materials in Mr. Mine?\n\nThe main source for building materials is caves. You can get up to 10x BM per treasure, and there are multiple BM treasure spots per cave.

Go on an epic adventure and slay monsters, upgrade heroes with the gold you collect, find treasures, and kill bosses. Clicker Heroes is a game that helped propel clicker games into the mainstream alongside other classics like Idle Breakout.\n\nHow to Play\nClick to kill\n\nEmbark on a quest to become a powerful warrior. Strike down each beast you see by clicking them repeatedly, then reap the gold rewards left behind. Every click you make has a single damage value that you can continuously upgrade for more power.\n\nHire heroes to help\n\nHire different heroes to help you take down monsters faster. Every hero has their own DPS and a set of upgrades that are sometimes unique. Often the hero upgrades allow further significant increases to their DPS. Heroes allow you to kill enemy mobs and take gold without lifting a finger.\n\nThe heroes get progressively more expensive, but you get what you pay for in strength and powerful upgrades. The further you get, the more heroes emerge, becoming your next big purchase that allows you to move further into more lucrative lands.\n\nExplore new lands and beat bosses\n\nEach region has new and exciting monsters to fight. Start at the forest and progress into drylands and other locations. At the end of each region, there is a difficult boss fight - the boss has extra health and takes all your might to vanquish! If you fail to beat the boss, you’ll bounce back to the previous stage where you can build your skills further before entering the fight again.\n\nDeveloper\n\nClicker Heroes is developed by Playsaurus.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJuly 2014.

Wield your sword and team up with companions to face thrilling battles. Strengthen your skills and overcome every challenge in your journey to victory!\n\nHow to Play Battle of Knights: Robby and Dragons\n\nYou start off with nothing but your bare hands: no armor, no weapons. It’s enough to get you through your first battles, but every fight you win brings you closer to valuable upgrades. Follow the arrows to navigate your first battle. A simple left-click is all it takes to engage your opponent.\n\nWinning your first battle earns you 100 coins, just enough to explore new gear. Head to the sword store to upgrade your combat power. Each sword comes with its own force multiplier:\n\n2x force for 1 coin\n4x force for 25 coins\n8x force for 100 coins\n12x force for 300 coins\n20x force for 500 coins\n50x force for 1000 coins\n80x force for 5000 coins\n100x force for 10000 coins\n120x force for 25000 coins\n150x force for 50000 coins\n\nThe pet store is another place to boost your strength. Pets provide valuable strength boosts:\n\n+3 strength for 5 coins\n+10 strength for 30 coins\n+30 strength for 100 coins\n+250 strength for 500 coins\n+800 strength for 1000 coins\n+3000 strength for 5000 coins\n+10000 strength for 25000 coins\n+20000 strength for 50000 coins\n\nYou’ll also want to upgrade your appearance. At the skin store, you can enhance various parts of your character, from your arms and beard to your body, cloak, feet, hands, head, helmet, and pants. Each upgrade not only changes your look but might just earn you the respect of your enemies and the princess!\n\nCoins are earned through combat. Fight a newbie for 1 coin, engage in a simple fight for 3 coins, test your skills in a medium fight for 6 coins, or take on a strong fight for 10 coins. When you’re ready for the ultimate test, challenge the dragon for 50 coins! Defeating tougher enemies means more coins and faster upgrades.\n\nYour journey is about more than just fighting, it’s about earning the right to face the boss and unlocking the portal to another world. Explore your surroundings with a 360-degree view, controlled by your mouse. The world of knights is vast, and every turn might reveal a new challenge or a new ally.\n\nAnd remember, the king promises his daughter, the princess, to the knight who defeats all the dragons. But only a worthy knight, one who has proven himself in battle and dressed for the occasion, can claim this honor. So gather your armor, prepare your weapons, and show the world you’re the hero it’s been waiting for.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nClicker games can be quite addictive thanks to their simple yet fun gameplay.

Unlock powerful bonuses and climb the ranks to airline tycoon!\n\nHow to Play Airline Tycoon Idle\n\nYour objective in Idle Airline Tycoon is to transform a small operation into a global airline fleet. Start with a modest amount of airplanes, two to be exact, with limited destinations, but soon you'll be connecting dozens of cities worldwide.\n\nGameplay is simple and made to keep you engaged (and relaxed!) as you click your fleet to take off as often as possible, driving up revenue and unlocking more upgrades. Fly as much as you can, and you will soon find yourself upgrading your airports and planes to gradually grow your airline empire.\n\nPurchasing a new airplane will set you back around $5,000, but it's a crucial step in expanding your airline. To gather the necessary funds, you'll need to fly your planes to the initial routes offered, like Rome, London, and New York, running consistent flights to build up your earnings. The goal is to master these routes and venture into new cities, steadily growing your airline’s reach. Every flight you run brings you closer to unlocking more destinations,\n\nEach choice you make shapes your airline’s success—expand air routes, optimize flight paths, and invest in airport upgrades to attract more passengers and increase your earnings.\n\nThe game combines strategy with the ease of idle gameplay, allowing you to earn profits with a click. But don’t just sit back—efficient management is key. Carefully plan your routes between cities to ensure smooth operations and steady profits, avoiding costly mistakes that could disrupt your flights.\n\nBon voyage!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nClicker games are the perfect way to unwind.

Your goal is to click and generate balls within this circle. You’ll start with a limited supply of balls, but they can gradually increase over time. The key is to keep as many balls bouncing inside the circle as possible, as each bounce increases their value. However, the circle rotates unpredictably, and the balls won’t always stay where you want them, making it tricky to control their movements.\n\nAs you advance through the game, watch for opportunities to supercharge your ball supply and skyrocket your earnings. Spot an x3 multiplier? Don’t hesitate—click it to triple your bounce points for a limited time instantly. From there, aim your balls with precision to hit the most valuable sections of the circle, racking up massive points and taking your score to new heights!\n\nYou’ll have the option to upgrade different elements, including adding more balls, boosting your income, widening the gap, or even creating additional circles. Each upgrade is locked until you’ve earned enough points, so strategy is key to unlocking more powerful features.\n\nAs the game advances, the difficulty ramps up. You'll encounter multiple rotating circles and balls that move faster with each level, challenging you to master timing, placement, and the physics of their bouncing patterns.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are just as many satisfying games to play on CrazyGames!

There are 32 distinct capybara evolutions spread across 4 diverse realms for you to explore. The capybara gets odder and odder as you merge.\n\nGet ready for a delightful adventure as your capybara collection thrives!\n\nTip\n\nWhen the board is full of mixed capybara, click on the more evolved capybara for more points.\n\nClick on capybara poop for more points.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIdle games can be meditative and relaxing, making them popular picks for everyday gameplay.

Create your team from over 50 unique heroes, each inspired by iconic characters you know and love. Dive into intense real-time PvP battles where your skills and tactics are put to the ultimate test. Join forces with fellow guild players to take on epic quests across breathtaking locations, from ancient ruins to mystical landscapes. As you progress, you can upgrade your heroes and gear, enhancing their abilities and unlocking new powers.\n\nHow to Play Battle Arena\n\nIn a world overrun by demons, you must choose a region at a time to combat your opponent. Battle Arena fights start off in Serenity Valley, where you can assess your enemy's squad in just a tap. You get to select your heroes for battle. You begin with only three heroes to play with, each with a different weapon and skill. But the amount of heroes you can eventually upgrade to is countless.\n\nEarly in the game, you will fight Dark Lord, who is less than happy to see you. To win the initial battle and every one afterward, you must use your hero's unique skills—some wield swords while others shoot arrows. Just tap on their avatars at the bottom of the screen to strengthen your attacks.\n\nIn Battle Arena, your objective is pretty much to build and upgrade your heroes and compete in various challenges, particularly in the arena. The gameplay revolves around gathering resources and gaining experience points to level up. Players can participate in raids to acquire new heroes and enhance their existing ones. The key to success in this game is to strategize by selecting the right battle heroes to maximize team effectiveness.\n\nAs you engage in battles, you must use different abilities and relics, which provide unique advantages during combat. Upgrading heroes is crucial to improve your performance in battles.\n\nAlways pay attention to your heroes' health and manage resources wisely, especially during expeditions and arena fights. Using a mix of heroes with complementary skills can lead to successful team combinations and help defeat stronger opponents.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to push through the ranks in the arena by strategizing hero placements and leveraging their abilities effectively. You can earn significant rewards as you progress, which can be reinvested into your hero roster.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore a wide array of adventure games at your fingertips!

You’ll have to solve tricky puzzles and face unpredictable mini-games throughout your escape attempt to get to freedom. Outsmart the odds and the guards, and you will be well on your way out of prison.\n\nHow to Play Prison Escape\n\nYou are stuck in a prison, the last place you want to be. Your goal is to plan and carry out a successful escape without being caught by the guards.\n\nYou start with a key, but it is not for your cell. The key you need to get out is in the next cell, and the only way in is through the toilet pathway. To enter, you must quietly unscrew the toilet bolts. Be careful because if you make too much noise, the guards will hear you. A “caught meter” shows how loud you are.\n\nLook under the bench to find a fork. Move the bench quietly, then use the fork as a screwdriver to remove the toilet bolts. Once the toilet is loose, move it aside and crawl through the vent into the next cell. In the next cell is Rhino, a tough inmate who will call the guards if he spots you. You must convince him not to by beating him in an arm wrestling match. Give it your all because your life depends on it.\n\nEscaping requires moving through multiple rooms, each with its own challenges. Some cellmates are not friendly, but their brute strength can be useful. Some can even break down walls, which could help you find a way out.\n\nGather useful tools like forks, keys, and lockpicks to aid in your escape plan. If you get stuck, do not hesitate to use hints, especially for tricky lockpicking. Always stay hidden when guards are near. If guards spot you, quickly find places to hide, including other prison cells, to avoid capture.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to reach the safe. Inside is a gun, which can level the playing field against the guards. Find a silencer, too, or one loud shot will immediately trigger alarms. Guards are not your only obstacle. Make it far enough, and you will face a dangerous series of alligators blocking your path. How far can you get? Can you escape prison alive?\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nPuzzle games can be quite thrilling, which is why we have a whole collection dedicated to them, all online and free to play!

Tiptoe across quiet hallways, avoid being seen, and use clever tricks to carry out your great escape. Your friends are waiting for you on the outside. Do you have what it takes to join them?\n\nHow to Play Schoolboy Escape\n\nThe game begins with a bad report card, filled with low grades and teacher complaints about your behavior. Your parents are furious, and rightly so. You are grounded and will have to stay in your room and study as punishment.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to sneak your way out without being caught. Running or making noise will get you noticed, so be stealthy.\n\nYou will have to solve mini escape puzzles to be able to leave, such as finding the spare key hidden somewhere in your room. Move around the house, checking inside cabinets, shelves, and drawers whenever possible. If your mom or dad catches you, you’ll be sent back to your room.\n\nYour mom comes in and out of your room from time to time, so to fool her and make her believe you’re studying, you will need to place a math book on your desk. Search around, including the hallway, for valuable items.\n\nYou’ll need keys to access other rooms, like the storage and bathroom. Avoid crossing paths with your parents, especially when they check on you.\n\nBeware of Your Parents' Bedroom\n\nSome essential items are in your parents’ room, but you must wait for your dad to leave before trying to access the safe. Find the password to open it.\n\nAs you progress, you’ll face new challenges in school, the village, and other locations, solving puzzles and sneaking past watchmen and other obstacles.\n\nUse distraction tactics to avoid detection and find keys, tools, and codes to unlock doors and safes. Always watch your surroundings, hide when necessary, and collect helpful items to aid your escape.\n\nHow far can you get before your parents catch you?\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFan of adventure games like this?

Now you’re locked up in a prison, forced to toil away in the mine as part of your punishment. But this isn't just any ordinary prison labor—there’s more at stake here than just digging for ores. You need to stay sharp and well-fed, so always stock up on food and enhancement potions before heading underground, or you’ll starve to death!\n\nAs you work through your grueling days, you’ll be assigned to incomplete building projects and resource extraction, where you’ll uncover hidden opportunities that could lead to your freedom. Keep your eyes peeled for the Super Pickaxe—a tool so powerful it could be your key to escape!\n\nAlong the way, visit merchants to purchase better pickaxes, potions, and other essential supplies to boost your mining efficiency. These tools will help you dig deeper, extract more valuable resources, and stay one step ahead of your captors. Who knows what secrets the mine holds? Keep digging, upgrading, and planning your way to freedom!\n\nChallenge yourself and earn maximum coins. Get to know the characters of the prison. Be attentive; perhaps they are hiding something from you. Get as many upgrades as possible so you can mine resources faster and more efficiently. Increase your luck to mine more resources per block. Upgrade your mine to generate more ore. Find, buy, and sell resources to merchants: new different kinds of picks, food, torches, dynamite, and much more.\n\nDon't get too used to this vibrant life in prison—your aim, after all, is to escape.\n\nTip\n\nEvery day, prices at shops are updated, so choose the moment when you can earn the most!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nEnjoy even more adventure games or arcade games, so the fun can continue.

After being thrown in a prison cell, you must use anything and everything at your disposal to escape: teleporters, anti-gravity equipment, toilet plungers—nothing is off limits in your attempt to escape! But be careful because one wrong move or a split-second hesitation could send you right back to your cell—or worse!\n\nDo you have what it takes to escape the prison? There's only one way to find out.\n\nHow to Play Escaping the Prison\n\nThe game begins with Henry Stickman, your character, in a lonely prison guarded by taunting security who brings you a package. This is where the theme of the game begins—choice. It is a puzzle game, so depending on the choices you make, your next step may or may not lead you to a true chance at escape. All the while, you get to know your character through trial scenes and learn about the bank robber that got you in jail in the first place.\n\nThe initial package contains a cake with a few potential items hidden inside—you can choose what's in the box! Choose from an energy drink, a teleporter, and a cell phone, and see what scenarios unfold, considering your choice.\n\nThe power of choice\n\nYou don't only get choices to help you escape from prison; in some scenarios, you also get to choose how your trial unfolds. The game is layered, so what you see is by no means a reflection of linear time.\n\nChoose the Cell Phone\n\nThis scenario gives Henry Stickman even more choices to make. He uses the cell phone to call his attorney and from them another scenario in court unfolds where you must choose the winning piece of evidence.\n\nChoose evidence presented at trial, such as a money bag your character hid in, a shovel, a mysterious device, a videotape of security footage, a letter from the detective, or bank floor plans. What should you choose? Will it free Stickman?\n\nThere is only one way to find out.\n\nChoose the NrG Drink\n\nHenry escapes from prison in this scenario, but at a great expense. The energy drink gives him strength enough to literally bend bars to escape, but on his way out, he suffers a heart attack and dies.\n\nChoose the Teleporter\n\nHenry does escape from prison using the teleporter. He is propelled outside of prison, but unfortunately, he does die in this scenario as the teleporter puts him right in the bull's eye view of a firing range where he is the prime target.\n\nWe won't spell out all the scenarios for you because part of the fun is actually seeing the consequences of your choice. So go ahead and choose!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more adventure games and puzzle games, be sure to check out Cut the Rope, where you solve physics-based puzzles to feed a cute monster, and Bolts and Nuts, which challenges you to connect gears and mechanisms.\n\nLooking for something a bit different?

You are trapped inside a small prison cell, and you must escape not just your cell but the whole prison! If you fail, death is awaiting you... The highly secured prison is guarded by some strong stick soldiers. You must make good and fast decisions to make it out alive. Good luck!\n\nHow to Play Fleeing the Complex\n\nThe entire game is based on quick thinking, strategy, and decision-making. Along the way, you'll find help from the environment and even old or new friends. Each sequel is tied into the previous game (i.e., Escaping the Prison happens because of Henry's criminal actions in Breaking the Bank). Not every choice you make will lead to a bad ending, but some lead to \"fails\" from the get-go. In Breaking the Bank, every choice will be a failure.\n\nThis is probably to set Henry up for his next adventure as he tries to escape from prison. The fact that you can't really predict which choice makes the most sense means Fleeing the Complex is just as unpredictable as the earlier games (except Breaking the Bank).\n\nReleased in 2015, Fleeing the Complex is the 5th and (so far) last sequel in the Henry Stickmin adventure series. Like the earlier games (Escaping the Prison, Stealing the Diamond, and Infiltrating the Airship), the goal is to choose the right paths, tools, and moves while you try to break into or out of different places to escape - or cause - trouble.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFleeing the Complex is a unique adventure game that puts your puzzle skills to the test.

Mine resources to upgrade weapons and tools, build a thriving village, and uncover hidden treasures. Unlock unique characters, set up automated production, and take down Cheater in an epic showdown!\n\nHow to Play Mini Mine\n\nYour mining adventure starts with an honorable task: freeing a kidnapped noob girl trapped by Cheater and claiming the coveted god’s pickaxe. Your mission includes exploring new islands, building bridges, and uncovering unique tools to assist you in your journey. Resources are key, and they can be gathered by delving into the mine.\n\nYour primary goal is to mine gems and resources of various types, including orange, green, blue, and white gems, coins, stones, and more. Start mining by walking to the main block and chipping away continuously. Extracted rewards will scatter: simply walk over them to collect them. Keep an eye out for alerts to “jump into the portal.” Entering the portal will occasionally replenish your mine, revealing new, unique, and more valuable resources to collect. However, note that the mine won't always replenish when you jump into the portal.\n\nMining has a gradual pace and requires persistence. The more you mine, the more rewards and currency you accumulate, unlocking the ability to purchase better tools and progress to higher levels. Early levels may feel slow: for instance, by level 2, you might have only mined seven coins. But patience is essential, as higher rewards and tools become accessible as you advance.\n\nTools & Upgrades\n\nUse your earnings to purchase tools and potions that enhance your mining efficiency:\n\nPotions start at $2500 and include:\n\nDouble block destruction speed.\nDouble the number of mined items.\nIncrease resource production from quarries and sawmills.\n\nPickaxe cost\n\nStone Pickaxe: $100\nIron Pickaxe: $500\nGolden Pickaxe: $2000\nDiamond Pickaxe: $5000\nCheater Pickaxe: $15,000\n\nGame Tips\n\nSell your stones. This will allow you to boost your purchase power by selling stones at the store.\nSlow and steady wins the race. Prices are high, so consistent mining is crucial to afford the best tools and upgrades.\nInvest in potions and upgraded pickaxes as soon as possible to speed up your progress.\nMore Games Like This\n\nBrowse our adventure category for even more fun.

As a staff member thrown into a horrifying situation, your goal is to uncover the truth behind the eerie events unfolding around you. Navigate through creepy environments, solve puzzles, and avoid lurking dangers as you piece together the sinister secrets hidden within. With every step, the tension rises as you face disturbing consequences for every wrong move. Will you survive the nightmare, or will you become another victim of the terror?\n\nHow to Play Iron Friend\n\nWelcome to your unsettling late-night shift, where an urgent call beckons: “Get here now. We need you to investigate the power outage.” You’ll explore the eerie, dimly lit grounds, guided by WASD controls to move, crouch, and interact with your surroundings. The air feels heavy, the silence broken only by unsettling sounds—this is no ordinary night.\n\nBegin by picking up items like keys using the F key, which will be stored in your inventory (Tab). Doors require hands-on interaction—look at them, wait for the hand icon, and then press LMB to drag them open. Your first mission is to find a flashlight in the shed and then locate the fuse box inside the main building. But restoring the power isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. You’ll need to gather crucial objects scattered throughout the eerie rooms, such as batteries, coins, cassette tapes, and more.\n\nClues are everywhere and play a vital role in your progress. Did you find a coin? Use it in a vending machine. Have you discovered a cassette? Play it in a cassette player for a chilling audio hint. Every object unlocks a piece of the mystery. Explore carefully—some items, like keys, unlock new areas, while others, like notes and strange markings, point to hidden objectives. Pay close attention to environmental details, as they often hold the answers to your next step.\n\nEventually, you’ll find a working computer and access its command prompt. Here, typing commands like “run humanist.exe” leads to strange tests and deeper layers of the story. As you navigate the darkened hallways, uncovering objects and solving puzzles, you’ll face the Iron Friend—your encounter with it may hold the key to survival. But beware: the more you explore, the more unsettling the atmosphere becomes. It's not so bad if you don't mind the screams that can be heard from a distance from time to time. The choice—and courage—to continue are yours.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere is more adventure to go around. Browse our adventure category for even more fun.

Use move keys to dodge enemy punches and hit back with random punch combinations. You can play against another player or AI.\n\nHow to Play Punchers\n\nPunchers throws players into the boxing ring for an intense boxing match where technique is key. Use the WASD keys to maneuver your fighter and get ready to throw jabs, cross punches, and more. The game features both realistic real-time matches as well as slow-motion combat, allowing players to perfect their moves and time their punches with precision.\n\nYou’ll be scored on total punches, landed punches, power punches, and accuracy. While you can spam the keys, success depends on skill and precision rather than random attacks. Take advantage of slow-motion mode to practice your moves and learn the timing needed for effective jabs and cross punches.\n\nEach punch has a recovery move, meaning you need to manage your timing carefully. Too many reckless attacks can leave you open for counter-punches. A stamina meter tracks your energy, helping you decide when to go on the offense or focus on defense to recover.\n\nAfter each round, you’ll get feedback on your performance, including stats like your best punch and overall effectiveness. If you win, expect a fun celebration with cheers, but if you lose, brace yourself for a bit of frustration.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore other exciting sports titles including popular soccer games like Soccer Random, a chaotic 2-player soccer game with bouncy physics and one-button controls, or Basket Random, where you bounce around and battle for the ball across various crazy basketball courts If you want to change the sport and try your luck at archery, Bowman, a game where you and an opponent take shots at each other. You win when you’ve hit the opponent fatally.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMay 2020\n\nDeveloper\n\nVardan Aleksanyan developed this game. You should also check the developer's other physics-based fighting game Striker Dummies.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 29, 2025\n\nControls\nLeft player use the WASD keys and Y, U\nRight player use arrow keys and numpad 1, 2\nFAQ\nWhat does punchers mean?\n\nPunchers is another word for a person who forcefully hits with their fists, such as a boxer.\n\nWhat is the #1 fighting game?\n\nChoosing the #1 fighting game all depends on what type of fight, sport, and graphics you prefer.

Hire top-tier trainers, equip your gyms with cutting-edge gear, and plan strategic fight plans. Scout talented fighters, recruit rising stars and guide them to championship glory. Every decision shapes your path to becoming the ultimate MMA manager.\n\nHow to Play MMA Manager 2\n\nTo become a champion in MMA Manager 2, you’ll need to start small, build your skills, and work your way up to owning a top-tier gym. Begin by recruiting your first fighter through the roster, where you can either hire a premade fighter or create your own from scratch. When making a fighter, you’ll first choose a weight class and skin type: these don’t affect performance. Then, customize your fighter’s identity with their name, hometown, and country of origin. Next, select a fight-style background, which determines their initial skill set.\n\nFighting Styles and Primary Skills:\n\nWrestling: Punches, takedowns, ground grappling. Wrestlers dominate ground positions, delivering powerful blows while keeping opponents pinned.\n\nTaekwondo: High kicks. A risky style relies on complex, high-impact kicks that can be devastating when executed effectively.\n\nMuay Thai (Elbows): Elbows, clinch work. Close-combat specialists use clinches and swift elbow combos to wear opponents down.\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ): Takedowns, ground grappling, submissions. BJJ fighters control ground situations and force opponents to submit with painful holds.\n\nKickboxing: Punches, low kicks. A striking style blending fast punches and relentless low kicks to overwhelm opponents.\n\nMuay Thai (Knees): Knees, clinch work. Knee-focused Muay Thai fighters deal significant damage with precision strikes during close combat.\n\nAfter recruiting, your fighters will begin competing in matches, but their actual growth happens in the gym. Train them to enhance their strengths or develop new skills. Training uses stamina, which gradually replenishes over time but cannot exceed a fighter’s maximum capacity. Check stamina levels in the gym view using the stamina ring, and ensure you’re training fighters as soon as they’re ready.\n\nEach match becomes progressively more complex, requiring strategic planning and practical training. Winning fights brings you closer to becoming a professional and achieving your dream of owning the best gym in the business!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nExplore some of our most exciting sports titles, starting with Basketbros, a fast-paced basketball game offering both online and offline gameplay. Next, try A Small World Cup, a mini-soccer game where you control a ragdoll and launch it across the arena to score goals.

See the chaos that happens when two boxers play when they are a little tipsy in the ring. With its whimsical physics and outrageous character movements, you'll discover that landing a solid punch is far more challenging than it appears—after all, your inebriated state keeps you stumbling and swaying.\n\nHow to Play Drunken Boxing\n\nDrunken Boxing gameplay is pretty straightforward using your WASD keys, but each move will yield mixed results, so keep bashing to try and get some kind of ‘punching’ action going. As a physics-based game, each move may appear a bit clumsy, but that’s a natural consequence of your guided controls.\n\nUse the left and right arrows to throw punches with each hand while pressing the down arrow, which shifts you into a defensive stance, retreating and potentially cornering yourself. Conversely, the up arrow propels you into an offensive position, charging forward toward your opponent.\n\nIf you’re playing the 2-player game, use WASD to move if you are on the left side. If you’re on the right, use the arrow keys.\n\nYour movements may not always be as crisp as you'd like, so it’s crucial to start punching immediately—hesitate, and you risk being attacked and losing control of your punches.\n\nYour objective is to knock out your opponent before your energy runs out. An energy bar above each player indicates how close you are to a knockout. If your energy depletes completely, you'll be knocked out of the ring and lose the round.\n\nTo win the game, you need to be the first to secure five match victories—the first to five takes home the championship! If you're on the left side, use WASD to maneuver; if you're on the right, use the arrow keys.\n\nYou can challenge the CPU for practice or join a friend for a head-to-head showdown, just like in many of our other exciting two-player games.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCheck out some more of our fun physics games, including games like House of Hazards, where your challenge is to outlast your friends by finishing tasks and avoiding hazards in this chaotic multiplayer game. If you're looking to continue the sports game fun instead, try some of our more popular titles like Basket Random, an arcade sports game with quirky, unpredictable physics, or Soccer Random, a chaotic two-player soccer game with one-button controls.\n\nRelease Date\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDeveloper\n\nThis game is made by RHM Interactive.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser\n\nLast Updated\n\nMar 27, 2023\n\nControls\n\nUse the WASD keys or the arrow keys\n\nFAQ\nWhat is a drunken boxing game?\n\nDrunken Boxing is a ragdoll 2-player boxing game where you try to win each game of boxing while under the influence whether you're playing against the computer or your friend.\n\nWhy is it called drunken boxing?\n\nThe movements in Drunken Boxing are typically less crisp and are more characteristic of uncoordinated movements while under the influence.\n\nGameplay Video"

It is an endless basketball practice where you aim to get your ball in the net in one shot. The goal is to keep playing until you can't anymore, so you may want to cancel all plans for the evening. Perfectly time your taps to score before the clock runs out, and keep going as long as you can!\n\nHow to Play Tap-Tap Shots\n\nThe gameplay in Tap-Tap Shots is pretty straightforward: it is a one-button game where each click propels your ball. Depending on your tap, your ball may or may not make the shot.\n\nThe net moves to a different height and location each time you make the shot. This will test your click skill. The game, in essence, is an endless series of rounds of practice shots. Your best scores are tallied, incentivizing you to improve upon your performance in the last round.\n\nThe key to the game is to find the right rhythm when tapping, hence the name tap-tap. How many taps do you need to make every shot?\n\nTap-Tap Tips\n\nKeep tapping to move the ball slightly until it reaches the net. If you miss, the ball will come back from the other side.\n\nWhen you score, another net is created in a new location: an endless cycle until you run out of time!\n\nTime your shots carefully and think fast before you run out of time. If you miss, it’s best to click quickly to get back around and try for another shot, but make sure you don’t overshoot again!\n\nGet “On Fire”\n\nWhen you score a few baskets in a row, the ball will become hot and burst into flames. This is an indicator of a successful scoring streak, as well as a way to score bonus points. You can additionally get bonus points for clean shots that don’t touch the rim.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more basketball games, have a shot at popular titles in our sports category, such as Basketball Stars, which brings fast-paced, one-on-one action.\n\nIf, instead, you want to try something different and enjoy simple, fun games, check out our hypercasual or one-button games for more. Popular games include Geometry Dash, Sprunki, and Little Alchemy.\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 2018\n\nDeveloper\n\nMaximiliano Demonte developed Tap-Tap Shots.\n\nPlatforms\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nControls\n\nLeft-click to dunk.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the best device to play Tap-Tap Shots on?\n\nSince the game features simple one-click mechanics, it works just as well on mobile and desktop devices.\n\nHow many lives do you have in Tap-Tap Shots?\n\nYou have unlimited lives, but each shot is timed. If you run out of time without scoring, it's game over.\n\nGameplay Video"

Players hop and kick on the pitch with just one click, trying to score a goal with limited movement. You can choose a one-player game against the computer or two-player with a friend as your opponent.\n\nHow to Play Soccer Random\n\nThe game rules and control are fairly simple. There is no strategy involved in Soccer Random; you will simply need to out-click your opponent till you score a goal.\n\nUse the up arrow or left-click to do your signature and only move. Each team has two players, and they move simultaneously. Each click controls both characters on your team, but only sometimes, as you would want. You can also hold your kick in the air by pressing and holding the action button. This can be useful when kicking randomly or doing nothing could work against you. Though sometimes doing nothing and just standing there can indeed score you a winning goal.\n\nAfter each goal in Soccer Random, you are transported to a new location with different characters. To win the game, one team must reach five wins before the other!\n\nYou can play Soccer Random solo or with a friend. Playing a two-player game evokes more action on the field, so try both and see which is more fun.\n\nWhat’s so random about Soccer Random?\n\nThe game's rules are straightforward - get the ball in the net to score a goal. Everything else is pretty much well… random. You will be playing with different backdrops, which include beach, cityscapes, snow fields, at nighttime, in broad daylight - you name it. The setting is random. The uniforms change as well. You may be wearing white, blue, or red. You may also be playing in the snow in your underwear or perhaps swimsuits. It’s hard to tell. It is random. The ball changes as well. Sometimes, you play with a classic soccer ball, other times with an American football, tennis ball, and even an inflatable beach ball. Even the players change with each match. It is random.\n\nTips\n\nEven if the moves are limited, you do want to be reactive, as the ball can quite easily drift under or over your player’s heads. Keep an eye on both players you are controlling. One is offense, and the other is the goalkeeper. One-click controls both, and moves between your two players don’t always align, so decide whose move is more important based on your opponent's moves.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you enjoyed Soccer Random, check out some more two-player games and join a friend in awesome free games.\n\nExperience something different by playing Moto X3M or Sprunki.\n\nFeatures\nPlay on various pitches\nUnique characters and settings\nLimited controls and wacky physics\nPlay the game with a friend or solo\nRelease Date\nFebruary 2020 (HTML5)\nMarch 2020 (Android)\nDeveloper\n\nRHM Interactive made Soccer Random.\n\nPlatforms\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\nAndroid\niOS\nLast Updated\n\nApr 06, 2023\n\nControls\n\nPress W or up arrow to jump and kick.\n\nFAQ\nCan I play Soccer Random on my phone?\n\nYes, you can play Soccer Random on your phone.

Use the Arrow Keys to move around the court and dribble past your opponent. Press and hold the Spacebar to shoot, releasing it at the right moment for a perfect shot. If you're close to the hoop, pressing Spacebar will let you perform a slam dunk. On defense, you can steal the ball by getting close to your opponent and tapping Spacebar when they’re dribbling. Time your jumps carefully to block incoming shots.\n\nAggressive play is key in Basketball Stars! When your opponent is on offense, stay close and look for the perfect moment to steal the ball.

You can play with the computer as your opponent or with friends.\n\nHow to Play Pill Soccer\n\nThere are several options. You can choose from quick matches, two-player matches, or an entire tournament.\n\nUse either the WASD or arrow keys to control your character. The aim of the game is to score more goals than your opponent. There is no kicking button in Pill Soccer. The best way to kick the ball is to push it. The harder you push, the further the ball will bounce towards your goal. You can also jump and use your head to get that goal.\n\nSoccer Pill is fun and quick, keeping you on your toes. The game controls are simple, but your player will act fast, so don’t underestimate how much power a click can provide.\n\nTips\nPractice with some of the quick matches to solidify your gameplay. Learn a few key moves to set yourself up for goals, and you should be ready for a tournament in no time.\nWhen the ball moves behind your pill but hasn’t quite hit the goal yet, don’t react. Go slow, jump backward, and become a goalkeeper to protect your net.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Pill Soccer, then you’ll probably enjoy many of the games found in our sports games category.

Rev up your engines and dive into intense matches to dominate the leagues. Unlock, purchase, and upgrade your cars to reign supreme in this thrilling automotive showdown. Gear up and become the ultimate champion of CarBall.io!\n\nHow to Play CarBall.io\n\nWhat do you get when you mix a soccer game with a driving game? You get CarBall.io. This unique game combines elements of driving gameplay, such as nitro boosts, with traditional soccer elements, including opposing teams, goal post defense, and offensive strategy. It may sound like an odd combination, but you will immediately love the combination as soon as you find yourself chasing a giant soccer ball across a field with bumper-to-bumper cars inadvertently cornering you as you try to bounce it with the hood of your car.\n\nThe game's objective is to score as many goals as possible in your opponent's net. You are part of a team of 3 cars, and AI controls your teammates. Scoring is easier said than done when you're driving. You will essentially need to push the ball with a car, and plenty of other cars will surround you with the same goal, so expect traffic jams.\n\nThe game offers limited customization options, but some features are available. You can choose the team color you'd like to join and the type of car you want to drive. This part is key. Select the car that aligns with your strengths and weaknesses. Each car is equipped with different attributes, all of which can be upgraded as you accumulate points.\n\nThese are:\n\nHealth: you car’s durability. Increasing this quality means you can withstand more collisions without impacting your car’s efficiency\nSpeed: your car’s maximum velocity\nDamage: this has to do with your power to damage other cars on the field\nMaxNitro: this quality relates to the duration of your speed boosts\nNitro Fill: a higher nitro fill increases the rate at which the meter regenerates after each usage\nTips\n\nIt's a driving game, so drifting is inevitable, especially when using your nitro boost. Stay balanced, and don't lose sight of the goal. When you drift, you can easily miss all gameplay, leaving all point scoring to your teammates.\n\nSometimes, the easiest way to turn is to make a 180-degree turn with your car. Use your brakes in combination with nitro boosts for sharper turns.\n\nThere is no official goalkeeper, so if you see your goal unmanned and the opposing team is getting close to scoring, this is a great chance to use your nitro boost and protect the goal net from opposing shots.\n\nBe careful about damaging your car by crashing into walls and other players on the field: your performance will be affected if you have too many collisions, and these might prevent you from being effective.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nCarBall.io is a unique mixture of sports and driving. If you want to try a few more sports games, defend your goal in Soccer Random or A Small World Cup.\n\nIf you prefer driving games, popular titles to try include Friday Night Funkin' or Moto X3M.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2024\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = movement\nShift = nitro\nSpacebar = brakes\nFAQ\nWhat is the oldest IO game?\n\nThe oldest IO game is considered Agar.io, created in 2015\n\nIs CarBall.io online?\n\nYes, you can play CarBall.io online at CrazyGames, along with a vast collection of other driving and sports games.\n\nGameplay Video"

This one-click button game lets you jump, spike, and scramble your way to victory, all with a few clicks. Keep alert because each move is pretty much unpredictable. Face off against your opponent in a series of random levels that keep you guessing. Voley Random is easy to play but tough to master, so keep playing!\n\nHow to Play Volley Random\n\nVolley Random is a very unique take on classic volleyball. Use your single-button control to hop both your characters up in the air to hit the ball. You can’t control the direction of your players. Instead, you have to rely only on your timing skills and wits to beat your friend.\n\nEach round of this 2-player game is marked by a different theme, ball, and changes in the game physics. In some rounds, you’ll have a football or longer arms; in others, the ball will be bigger or heavier. There are many possibilities. You’re transported to a new scenario with every goal scored. There are various wacky changes to keep you on your toes! You can play Volley Random with a friend or solo against the computer.\n\nYou will play in a variety of fun and unpredictable locations, with wacky physics that keeps every match exciting and fresh.

Collect orbs and battle other players to evolve your warrior. Each evolution improves your weapon range but slows your movement. How many will you slay before you fall?\n\nHow to Play EvoWars.io\n\nEmbark on an epic quest across the digital battlefield, where you’ll collect powerful orbs to evolve your warrior into unstoppable forms. As you slash through enemies with swords, axes, and a brutal arsenal of weapons, each battle pushes you closer to becoming the ultimate warrior. With more than 15 unique character models to unlock, your journey is one of constant evolution and power.\n\nYou control a constantly advancing warrior with your mouse, swinging your weapon to defeat enemies and collect XP to evolve into stronger forms with bigger weapons and greater attack range. As you play, you'll unlock more evolutions and customize your warrior with different weapons and gear to eliminate all other fighters on the field while growing stronger.\n\nAs you accumulate points, you will be able to upgrade gameplay dynamics. It will take some time to reach your desired destination. It's not the easiest game to master.\n\nThe key to this 2D top-down game is winning battles. Each victory allows you to grow stronger, but the battlefield isn’t just about brute strength; you’ll need to define your play style and use every opportunity to outmaneuver your enemies.

This community-based game is based on progressive management of your farm, so be sure to stay logged in to get the whole experience. Grow a garden from a humble carrot and tomato harvest to a gorgeous, rare plant paradise filled with blossoms, fruits, and exotic crops that showcase your farming mastery!\n\nHow to Play Growden.io\n\nGrowden is one of those games you start playing on a random evening and find yourself still playing two months later. Its rotating community rooms filled with players from all around the world, constant reward system, and continuous growth cycle make this game very hard to put down.\n\nYou start with basic $10 carrot seeds that disappear once you pick them. Then you move on to strawberry seeds for $50. Work your way up to something more uncommon, like blueberry seeds for $100, or rare seeds like tomato seeds for $800. (The rarer, the more expensive!)\n\nHow to plant seeds and harvest in Growden:\nBuy seeds, then click on them in your inventory to put them in your hands.\nClick on the brown plots in your farm to place them wherever you want them to grow.\nWait as your plant begins to grow. (Meet other farmers or shop as you wait!)\nOnce it’s fully grown, harvest by clicking E and enjoy the rewards!\nSell your plants at the shop when ready.\n\nWhen you've mastered the basics of farming, you will soon find yourself itching to save for the ultimate seed (cue the music): the moon blossom, which costs tens of millions.\n\nEveryone Wants the Moon Blossom\n\nBefore you get to the moon blossom, you’re likely going to encounter any one of these seeds: eggplant, bamboo, pepper, beanstalk, pumpkin, cacao, cauliflower, cactus, watermelon, dragonfruit, mango, coconut, nectarine, pear, avocado, banana, pinklily, pineapple, kiwi, candy blossom, cherry blossom, or sugar apple.\n\nSlow and steady wins the farm race, but once you get a candy blossom or cherry blossom, you’re likely to reach a whole new level of farming where your earnings begin reaching six or seven figures.\n\nThe more money you have, the more you can deck out your garden. Buy eggs at the egg shop. Each garden is allowed five pets. Pets help you harvest—not too much, but considering the game allows them to harvest while idle or away, you could find yourself with interesting items in your backpack when you’re back from a break.\n\nOnly 100 items fit into your backpack, so after each harvest, be sure to go sell your goods. You can sell one thing, price your items, or sell your entire inventory. It’s always fun to price new, shiny, and one-of-a-kind fruits.\n\nMutated Plants\n\nMutations on your plants happen during weather events. Mutated plants are worth more. The types of direct mutations are: Silver, Golden, Rainbow, and BIG mutations (which make your plants HUGE; this is a very rare mutation).\n\nThere are currently 5 weather events, with more coming soon: Daytime, Nighttime, Desert, Rain, and Frosty. Grow a Garden is receiving continuous updates, which will unlock new weather events, mutations, seeds, plants, and more.\n\nGifts in Growden\n\nThis is a community-based game. The community is very active and includes a Discord channel. Where there is community, there is sharing. Depending on what room you are in, you can find some very generous players who gift you expensive flowers or fruits.\n\nOn the downside, there is also stealing, but this is a bit less common than kindness in these gardens. There is a chat, and if a farmer steals, you will get a notification and can call them out. Usually, a public note will deter further stealing.\n\nEssential Tips to Grow a Garden in Growden.io\nStay logged in so you can keep your progress. If you log out and refresh your browser, you're likely going to lose your garden.\nIf you ever feel uncomfortable in a room, refresh your page, and it will get you to a new room.\nStay anonymous in the chat and don't give out any personal info.\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Growden, you may want to check out our .io selection of games with classics like Agario, or go for similar graphics in Bloxd.io, or try something different like Skribbl.io.\n\nControls\nWASD and arrow keys = move\nSpace = jump\nE = pick up plants or talk to the seed shop/sell area\nHold the right mouse button = move the camera\nFAQ\nIs Grow a Garden on CrazyGames?\n\nGrowden: Grow a Garden is on CrazyGames and can be played for free on desktop or mobile.\n\nIs Grow a Garden free to play?\n\nYes, Grow a Garden: Growden is free to play, depending on where you play it. CrazyGames features Grow a Garden: Growden for free.\n\nWhy is Grow a Garden so addictive?\n\nThere are several reasons it's hard to put Grow a Garden down. There is a very generous reward system that incentivizes players to keep coming back, and the community in the rooms is constantly rotating, which makes each room a completely new social adventure.\n\nGameplay Video"

Cannonballs require precision to be effective, but can eliminate multiple adversaries simultaneously.\nSpiky-Go-Round: activating the spiky-go-round will add rotating balls with spikes to your vehicle, which will make any contact with opponents lethal for them.\nNuke: a very powerful missile that has a wide impact radius.\nLobgrenuke: with a lobgrenuke you are placing a TNT-like static bomb on the ground. It gets activated when one of your enemies passes nearby or a few seconds after deployment.\nSnowball Blaster: fires ice at opponents and blocks them for 3 seconds in a block of ice. Touching this block while active will eliminate the kart containing it.\nInvincibility: the most powerful of all weapons, allows you to neutralize any shot aimed at you and, at the same time, to take down any kart by simply touching it.\nCustomize your kart!\n\nChoose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items!

You begin small and slowly work your way to conquer the world. Take control of 72% of the map, and victory is yours.\n\nHow to Play Front Wars\n\nFront Wars is a real-time strategy game where you go to war with other players in an attempt to expand your territory and protect your people. The game panels are pretty intricate and give you a lot of info to keep track of attacks and alliances. Use these wisely to plan your next moves.\n\nThe Event Panel shows everything happening in the game. You’ll see alliance requests, incoming attacks, and Quick Chat messages. You can focus on a player sending an alliance request, track incoming attacks, and retreat troops if needed, though this costs 25 percent of your attacking troops. Boats can return to their starting point if the land has changed hands, but nukes cannot be recalled. Quick Chat makes it easy to send preset messages or emojis to allies and opponents.\n\nAlliances are important. You can send or receive troops and gold to help your allies, whether they are under attack or building up their strength. Betraying an ally ends the alliance, pauses trade for a few minutes, and leaves you with weaker defenses. You’ll also be marked as a traitor for 30 seconds, so think carefully before making a move. Bots and human players react differently depending on your actions, so diplomacy matters.\n\nThe Radial Menu is your main control hub. Right-click a location to build, attack, send boats, request alliances, or betray an ally. The Options Panel lets you pause or unpause the game, check the timer, access settings, and see detailed information about other players. Hover over a country to see if it’s a human, a smart AI, or a bot, and find out how they feel about you.\n\nThe Game UI helps you track your progress. The leaderboard shows top players by land, troops, and gold, while the control panel lets you adjust your attack ratios. Icons tell you who is an ally, a traitor, or has stopped trading, which helps with planning your next move.\n\nBuildings and Units in Front Wars\nCity: Increases population and lets you expand your territory\nDefense Post: Protects borders, slows enemy attacks, and increases enemy losses\nPort: Lets you build Warships and trade with other ports, either automatically or manually\nWarship: Patrols water, intercepts enemy trade ships, and attacks enemy vessels\nMissile Silo: Launches atomic, hydrogen, or MIRV bombs\nSAM Launcher: Intercepts enemy missiles with different success depending on the type of bomb\n\nBombs have different effects.

You control one of these weapon-wielding eggs in one of four online game modes where the aim is to shatter your opponents with bullets and bombs. It's the ultimate online egg shooting game!\n\nKids love games where they shoot other players. Whatever you think about guns this seems to always be the case. We let our children play Shell Shockers before the older rating games with guns because it's a less violent way to have fun online. In fact, they enjoyed it so much that even though they are older they still go back to play this again and again.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Shell Shockers\n\nJump into the game and select your character name, customize your egg,  and choose one of four game modes. In this game, you must work hard to protect yourself and dish out damage to opposing eggs. Try out each game mode and see if you can conquer the Shell Shockers arena. \n\nTips and tricks\nPlay tactically\nAct quickly\nCollect egg ammunition\nThink like an egg\nGame modes\nTeams\n\nJoin a team (either red or blue) and fight against the enemy eggs until your team has the most kills collectively.\n\nFree For All\n\nEvery egg for themselves. If you see an egg, you shoot. Unless you want to be scrambled yourself. There is only one winner in this mode.\n\nCaptula the Spatula\n\nTwo teams battle for control of the spatula. The team with the spatula earns points for kills, but these can be lost if the player holding the spatula dies.\n\nKing of the Coop\n\nKing of the Coop was added in December 2021 with a host of cosmetic items and a new map. Two teams battle to capture a defined area known as the coop. The players on the winning team get 250 golden eggs each!\n\nWeapons\n\nThere are seven main weapon types in Shell Shockers. Each weapon has its advantages and drawbacks. If you have eggcellent aim, a weapon like the Crackshot would be great. If you’re more of a spray-and-pray type, try out the Whipper. The complete weapon list for Shell Shockers is:\n\nEggK-47 - classic medium-range automatic\nScrambler - high-damage shotgun\nFree Ranger - semi-automatic sniper rifle\nRPEGG - huge damage RPG\nWhipper - close to medium range rapid-fire rifle\nCrackshot - bolt-action sniper rifle\nTriHard - accurate medium-range burst-fire rifle\n\nAdditionally, each player has an additional gun and can pick up grenades from the map.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe game uses Golden Eggs as currency; you can use them to upgrade the way your character appears in the game or the weapons it uses. Mind you, using the Golden Eggs in the shop won’t allow you to buy items that give you an advantage during combat.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nFor more online shooting games, check out our multiplayer io games and browse the selection, which includes the highly popular Agar io.\n\nIf you are looking for something totally different, consider trying Bubble Shooter or 2048.\n\nFeatures\nFast-paced FPS gameplay\nA unique theme centered around eggs\nVarious weapons and game modes \nEgg customization and a shop for more items\nDeveloper\n\nShell Shockers is developed by Blue Wizard Digital (formerly known as the Egg and Dairy Ministry of Belarus).

Gather resources, build your base, and evolve through upgrades while battling rivals and their creatures.\n\nHow to Play Taming.io\nCraft and Upgrade\n\nIn the beginning, it’s just you and your pet. You can choose to spawn besides a wolf, a rabbit or a bear. You should quickly start harvesting resources to defend yourself, attack others and generate additional future resources.\n\nYou can collect four different types of goods:\n\nWood\nStone\nFood\nGold\n\nWood and Stone are essential to create tools and weapons, but also to build your base and the defensive structures supporting it.\n\nFood is useful to heal and to recover stamina, while gold is used to buy equipment, but it also contributes to your score.\n\nAs you start your harvest, you begin aging and each time you age, you’ll receive a selection of rewards that boost your capabilities as a survivor. These rewards can be anything from food items to recovery health, tools, and weapons.\n\nWaste no time getting started. Start building your fortress and fortify it with walls and turrets. One of the most important buildings to unlock for your base is the windmill. This structure generates gold for you automatically.\n\nTame Pets\n\nThe unique angle of Taming is the pet battles. You can choose from a selection of pets at the start, but you can also tame up to two additional wild animals. The primary method for discovering new beasts to tame is to locate wild baby animals on the map; these are often found sleeping. There is no guarantee that the animal you are approaching will be happy to be tamed, but you can increase your chances of success by using items like apples and stones, which give you a 1% boost to tame certain animals.\n\nYou can also equip yourself with special gear, like the Tamer’s Cap and the Luck Hat, as well as a dedicated tool that shoots apples, aptly named the Appletor, to have more opportunities to tame animals.\n\nAny animal has a magical type, and there are four different types of magic in Taming.io:\n\nFire\nWater\nPlant\nElectric\n\nTry to build a squad of pets with complementary magic types to increase your chances of success in this game.\n\nBuild a Team\n\nSince Taming is a multiplayer .io game, you share the world with numerous other gamers. It’s a good idea to get in touch with some of them to form a team. Doing it alone will be more challenging as you face other teams and higher-level players who will dominate you.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nTaming.io is similar to other multiplayer io games, such as Agar io.\n\nA different approach to playing with animal-like creatures is found in Sprunki, where you use them to create music. Another musical game on CrazyGames, although unrelated to the world of animals, is Friday Night Funkin’.\n\nFeatures\nFight magical battles with other players\nTame wild animals to fight for you\nCollect various resources \nBuild and fortify your base\nUnlock more rewards as you age\nRelease Date\n\nNovember 2020\n\nDeveloper\n\nLapaMauve developed Taming.io.\n\nPlatform\n\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 24, 2023\n\nControls\nWASD or ZQSD or arrow keys to move\nLeft mouse button to attack\nFAQ\nHow do you chat in Taming.io?\n\nYou can press the enter key to open chat.\n\nWhat is the strongest pet in Taming.io?\n\nNo pet stands out as the strongest. Some top choices are the Black Cat, Armadillo, and Ice Fairy.\n\nWhat can you play Taming.io on?\n\nTaming.io, it can be played on mobile, desktop, and tablet. You can enjoy this Io game from most devices.\n\nWhat is the weakest pet in Taming io?\n\nNormal types are considered the weakest and least effective in the game.\n\nGameplay Video"

Try to trap your opponents so you can get all of their delicious food.\n\nPressing the left or right mouse button allows you to turbo-speed your worm. Use it sparingly and tactically to sprint ahead of the other players and secure big rewards, but be advised: the more you use your turbo, the faster your worm shrinks.\n\nAs you get larger, you get slower. Turbo also becomes more costly for your score, so use it sparingly when you are big and plentifully when you are small.\n\nBe aware that upgrades you can buy in the menu don't make your worm perform better in the arena, but improve the effectiveness and/or duration of the power-ups found while playing, so don't be tricked by those.\n\nWorm Outfits\n\nGo to the wardrobe and pick an outfit fitting for the common worm. As you level up in the game, you can treat your worm to funkier and more colorful designs. Head to the worm's wardrobe on the main menu to pick a fresh new outfit.\n\nGame Options\n\nHead to the options menu to choose your favorite colors for the game. You can also pick between 3 different food types. You can find the options menu at the bottom right of the main menu.\n\nGame Modes\n\nThere are various game modes to choose from. These are:\n\nInfinity - Keep playing and growing your worm until you fail.\nTime - a 7-minute game featuring double points and coins\nTreasure Hunter - Look for treasures on the map\nSeasonal - these are time-limited modes that appear during seasonal periods of the year\nPower-ups\n\nKeep your eye out for power-ups in potion bottles scattered around the arena. There are six types of power-ups in Worms Zone:\n\nRed and blue - Increase capture radius and pull in more food.\nBlue - Increase the amount of food eaten by five times.\nPurple - Reveal where other worms have perished.\nGreen - Increase the speed of your worm.\nRound green - Improves control of the worm for collision avoidance.\nYellow - Zoom out for a bird-eye view of the map.\n\nYou'll figure out what these power-ups look like as you slither through the land. You can also pick up coins that go into your coin stash.\n\nSeasonal events\n\nMake sure to come worming your way back for seasonal events over times like Christmas, Halloween, and Easter! You can play in exclusive, limited-time events to earn rewards throughout the festive seasons.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWorms Zone, like many other .io games on CrazyGames, is simple yet incredibly fun and addictive. The typical .io game features online multiplayer, minimal appearance, and is free to play.\n\nA similar multiplayer game is Agar.io, where you'll also have to make sure your character grows.

Like Slither.io, you take control of a worm and nurture it to become a healthy, strong, indestructible snake. How do you get there? Eat shiny bits and grow big to eliminate the other worms.\n\nHow to Play Gulper.io\n\nYou are on a standard arcade board filled with neon bits of food to eat: think about it like Snake meets Tron. The gameplay is straightforward: mouse movements guide the only moves you can make, and clicking will give you a boost. There is no way to pause or stop in your tracks. The game aims to help you eat as much as possible, so you become longer, stronger, and thicker. Why? If other snakes bump into you, they will die. Oh yeah, multiple other snakes are fighting for the same food and territory!\n\nThe game never ends. Or rather, it ends when you die. Avoid other snakes on the board at all costs if you want to make it to the infinite end.\n\nDifferences with similar titles\n\nUnlike other snake-inspired titles, in Gulper.io, there are no power-ups or boosts, nor is there any in-game currency. The game lacks depth and employs a simple, minimalist approach to hook players quickly.\n\nA remarkable difference between Gulper io and other snake-themed games is that here, using the speed boost doesn’t consume your character, so you can go at full speed as much as you want. That, of course, increases the danger of hitting any of your competitors on the playing field, so use it with care.\n\nMunch and grow\n\nSlither and slide around the battle arena, munching on glowing orbs to grow bigger. Use a left-click or press the spacebar to boost your speed.\n\nBe a cunning little neon glow worm\n\nCut off other worms cunningly to make them crash into your side. Doing so successfully rewards you with all the food they collected in their time in the Gulper world.\n\nBecome engrossed in the glow\n\nGulper blends Tron-like neon visuals with the gameplay of explosively popular browser games like Worms Zone and Paper.io 2.\n\nFeatures\nCool neon glowing visuals\nSmooth movement and gameplay\nMinimap to see the location of other worms\nChange your worm color using the slider\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more addictive IO games to choose from. Have a look at our collection to find some gems like Agar.io, which has you devouring cells to become the biggest blob on the board.\n\nFor a different kind of action, try Moto X3M or Snow Rider.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2018\n\nDeveloper\n\nGulper.io is made by tonsomar.\n\nPlatform\nWeb browser (desktop and mobile)\niOS\nControls\n\nPress the left mouse button to boost speed at the cost of your size.\n\nFAQ\nHow can I grow large without dying in Gulper.io?\n\nTake bigger risks when you are smaller but avoid the much bigger opponents if you want to survive.\n\nWhen does the game end in Gulper.io?\n\nThe game is continuous and only ends when you die. You can keep growing for as long as you survive!\n\nGameplay Video"

The aim is simple: move around the map and destroy the other players whilst improving and upgrading your own circle.\n\nHow to Play Diep.io\nShoot to level up\n\nDiep is a simple .io game set in a vast arena. You start as one basic level 1 tank. Upgrades can reach up to level 45, and with every fifteen levels, you get to choose a new tank with special features. Check the bottom left of your screen to see if you are eligible for an update.\n\nVenture around the map, shooting various geometric shapes to level up. It’s best to do this for a while before trying to take on other opponents, as each level-up rewards you with an upgrade point to spend on one of 8 areas to upgrade.\n\nUpgrade your Diep circle\n\nThere are eight different stats you can upgrade:\n\nHealth Regen - health recovers faster\nMax Health - increases the maximum health\nBody Damage - increases the damage dealt by clashing with other items on the map\nBullet Speed - improves the speed of projectiles\nBullet Penetration - allows bullets to pass through more objects and other bullets before disappearing\nBullet Damage - grows the damage dealt by each projectile\nReload - decreases the time between shots\nMovement Speed - increases the tank's speed\n\nConsider your choices carefully, as you only have a limited number of skill points, and these are harder to acquire as you level up.\n\nA player may want to focus on their bullet damage and speed to increase firepower. Alternatively, you could concentrate on health and regeneration to improve your survivability. Players earn more skill points as they do damage and level up.\n\nTry different game modes\n\nThe main mode is a free-for-all, where every player is for themselves.\n\nOther game modes are:\n\nTag - you will be assigned to one of the two teams, and when a player is killed, they respawn in the opposite team. The winning team will have converted all their opponents into members of their squad.\nMaze - free-for-all with impenetrable walls and small corridors, easier to ambush and be ambushed.\nSandbox - a private game mode where players can test builds and classes with their friends.\n2 teams or 4 teams - you will be assigned to one of the teams (Red, Blue, Green, Purple). The bases in the corners of the map offer a safe area to respawn and recover.\nDomination - Dominators is the name of special turrets that teams in this mode fight to capture and control.\n\nTry out the different game modes and see which ones suit your play style. Don’t forget to choose your circle color and a gamer tag too!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThis game is available on web browser and also through the app store. Check out Agar.io for another legendary IO game or check out some other top titles like FNF - Friday Night Funkin' or Little Alchemy.\n\nDeveloper\n\nMatheus Valadares made Diep.io.\n\nRelease\n\nApril 2016\n\nPlatforms\n\nDiep.io is available as a web browser game (utilizing HTML5), as well as Android and iOS apps.\n\nControls\nDesktop\nWASD or arrow keys = Move your tank around\nMouse movement = Aim weapon\nLeft mouse button = Shoot\nMobile\nUse the virtual controllers to move, aim, and shoot\nTap the buttons to upgrade the tank and navigate the game\nFAQ\nWhat is the most powerful class in Diep.io?\n\nThere are many strong tanks in Diep, however there are three in particular that stand out. These are:\n\nDestroyer\nOverlord\nSniper\nHow do you create your own tank in Diep.io?\n\nAlthough some sources make this claim, it’s currently not possible to create your own tank in this game unless you are playing the Sandbox mode.\n\nGameplay Video"

You start with a random block color, and you must try to convert all the blocks on the map into the same color. This might sound easy, but don't forget there are other players to contend with!\n\nWhile heavily influenced by popular predecessors like Splix.io and Paper.io, Tileman.io offers additional features that distinguish it from these older games. For example, here you can pause the movement of your character by pressing E or P, a tactical move that can enable you to eliminate opponents more easily.\n\nHow to Play TileMan.io\n\nTileMan.io gameplay is relatively simple, but the strategy is not as straightforward. You are in the center of a grid board, and your objective is to expand your territory by claiming more and more tiles. To do this, move your mousepad or use the WASD keys to move left, right, up, and down. Easy enough? The catch is that you need to expand your territory without getting cut off by one of the many other players in the game. You can get cut off if your line of path is cut. Be careful because you can actually cut within your own path and lose the game by accidentally killing yourself. The only way to protect yourself is by remaining on your territory, but doing so won't get your expansion strategy very far.\n\nTerritory is \"claimed\" when you convert blocks by creating a complete square—the enclosed blocks will turn to your color once you close the gap. If you go too far and attempt to expand too fast, you will find yourself too far from safety and will likely be killed by an opponent player.\n\nYou must avoid your opponents or try to trap them within your squares and make them crash into you. Use a careful approach, and don't go in all guns blazing! Can you conquer the TileMan arena?\n\nHow is Tileman.io scored?\n\nTileman.io is scored based on the number of tiles captured, the number of amounts killed, and rank.\n\nTileman.io Game Options\nClassic\nExtreme Speed\nNo Kills\nRats\nArena\nClassic game\n\nIn this game, you play with multiple opponents in an attempt to expand your territory across almost 160,000 tiles. Gameplay moves at a quick pace, but achieving continental domination is possible with persistence and caution.\n\nExtreme Speed\n\nSimilar to the classic game, this one is significantly more challenging, so extreme caution or extreme risk will win. The choice is yours.\n\nNo Kills\n\nGameplay is similar to the classic game, but you don't get killed by opponents cutting into your path. Instead, lose your pathline and have just a few seconds to return to safe territory. Don't stray too far, or you won't make it back, and then it's game over.\n\nRats\n\nOpponents are everywhere in this game, the map is smaller and there is more density. Keep your captures close to home base.\n\nArena\n\nThe gameplay in Arena is almost like a \"practice space\". There are no opponents, and approximately 1,500 squares to capture. Sounds easy, but it's also easy to become too confident and make a mistake.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more games like Tileman.io in our Io selection. In Agar io you compete against other players for dominance.\n\nAlternatively, you can try Sprunki or Friday Night Funkin', two popular music games that are great fun.\n\nRelease Date\n\nDecember 2018\n\nFeatures\nA .io game that is inspired by Paper.io.\nYou can stop the movement\nVarious game modes, including an Extreme Speed mode to play the game at an insane speed\nPlayable on mobile browsers\nPlatforms\n\nTileman.io is a web browser game (desktop and mobile).\n\nLast Updated\n\nNov 29, 2024\n\nControls\nWASD or arrow keys to move\nE or P to stop\nSpace, Z and X for communication\nFAQ\nIs Tileman.io multiplayer?\n\nTileman.io is multiplayer, and that is what makes it so much fun.

Expand your realm by strategically capturing new territories, all while defending against rival players and unpredictable threats. Rally your forces to claim vital lands, strengthen your holdings with upgrades, and skillfully plan your conquests to rise to the top of the leaderboard. With every decision you make, you’ll inch closer to ultimate domination.\n\nHow to Play Kiomet\n\nThe goal of Kiomet is to expand your territory and master tactical moves in a dynamic real-time strategy setting. Take control by dragging units to towers to capture them, then fortify your strongholds by selecting and upgrading towers with enhancements. With 27 unique towers and ten diverse unit types marked by distinct symbols, every decision matters as you build your path to ultimate domination.\n\nVictory hinges on capturing and holding as many towers as possible, but defending your king is critical—losing it will cost you the game. Develop a strategy that balances offense and defense: build supply lines for resources, strengthen your buildings to boost capabilities, and consider alliances with other players to maximize your success. Working with allies can be a game-changer, as it may prevent being overrun by enemy forces while expanding your territory and resources.\n\nTo gain ground, drag and drop your forces to unclaimed areas, but be strategic, as occupying new territory takes time, leaving you vulnerable to counterattacks. Follow the directional arrows to see where to expand next, but think carefully about each choice, as capturing the right buildings can amplify your strength. Make tactical decisions to avoid being surrounded, and position yourself to attack your enemies to claim more land and resources.\n\nIn this multiplayer experience, teaming up with other players can add a crucial layer of strategy. Use the chat messaging function to request or accept alliances, which prevent attacks between allies. Keep communication open to coordinate defenses and time attacks, and build a formidable coalition. You can dominate the battlefield and expand your empire—one tower at a time.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the strategic art of Kiomet, check out some more of our IO games.

Play as a simple agar cell fighting to become the largest cell in a multiplayer game arena. Avoid the bigger cells and consume the smaller ones to grow larger.\n\nThis is a simple game about growing your single-cell organism bigger than other players. We love it in our family because there is a surprising amount of strategy and collaboration. You need to pay attention to other players to decide if you are bigger or smaller than them. Taking your time and hiding behind virus cells is a tactic our youngest used a lot. Best of all, though, splitting your cell to offer another player a way to grow is commonly seen as a sign to work together. We’ve had long games where we end up hunting in packs with others. It’s a great way to learn cooperation.\n\nReview by FamilyGamingDatabase.\n\nHow to Play Agario\n\nIn Agar.io, you begin as a tiny cell in a massive arena filled with pellets and other players. At the start, your best move is to quietly gather pellets scattered around the map. This lets you grow without drawing too much attention from larger predators. Avoid chasing other small players right away—most beginners get eaten this way. Patience pays off: focus on steady growth until you’re big enough to hunt.\n\nThe game has 2 simple rules to follow:\n\nYou can only consume targets that are smaller than you to evolve\nLarger agar will eat you\n\nSlide around the Agario battleground, trying to exist as a single cell looking to evolve. Think like a survivor - don’t just avoid bigger agar, go in for the kill and eat as much as you can!\n\nPick up all the smaller blobs and eat the other players to grow larger in size. Avoid blobs bigger than you as they will consume you, which means game over! But you can always start the game over and go for your next best record.\n\nOnce you reach medium size, movement slows, so you’ll need to be more tactical. Use your ability to split (Space key or split button) to lunge at smaller cells just out of reach. A successful split doubles your number of cells but halves their size, so choose your targets wisely. Always make sure the prey is small enough that even your split cell can absorb them; otherwise, you’ll just leave yourself vulnerable.\n\nTo climb higher, learn to use viruses to your advantage. As a small cell, viruses act as safe zones where big predators won’t dare follow. As a larger cell, you can eject mass into a virus to fire it toward enemies, popping them into pieces and giving you a chance to swallow their fragments. This is one of the most effective ways to topple giants on the leaderboard.\n\nWinning in Agar.io isn’t about brute force; it’s about survival, timing, and positioning. Hug the edges of the map when you’re small, move toward the center once you’re stronger, and always look for opportunities to trap opponents against the map’s borders. The ultimate goal is to balance risk and reward: grow big enough to dominate, but not so reckless that a single virus or split leaves you scattered and eaten.\n\nAbout Agar.io\n\nInitially, Agar.io user feedback was mixed. According to Engagdet.com, it was seen as \"a good abstraction of the fierce survival-of-the-fittest competition that you sometimes see on the microscopic level.\" However, there was also some criticism of the simplicity of the gameplay. This was mainly targeted towards the repetitiveness and the controls of the mobile version. Tom Christiansen of Gamezebo said, \"Personally, I found nothing to hold my attention in Agar.io but that shouldn’t stop you from giving it a shot if it looks even remotely interesting to you.\"\n\nNevertheless, Agar.io quickly became a success, likely due in part to its frequent discussion on social media platforms, particularly Twitch and YouTube. The mobile version of the game was downloaded more than ten million times during its first week, and in 2015, Agar.io was Google's most-searched video game. In the same year, it was even listed as the fifth top game on YouTube’s list of top games.\n\nSo, it's safe to say it's got some appeal!\n\nDid you know?\n\nAgar.io was also featured in the Netflix TV series House of Cards! It made its appearance in Season 4, Episode 9 (Chapter 48) with Frank Underwood shown playing the game while meeting with Will Conway.\n\nGame Modes\n\nThere are four game modes in Agar.io. These are:\n\nFFA (Free For All) - everyone fights for themselves\nBattle Royale - Everyone fights for themselves in a shrinking arena\nTeams - Two teams fight against each other\nExperimental - Every player for themselves. Donate your mass to the pellets to get more bits in return!\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Agario, you should definitely try out our other .io games like Paper.io, a real-time multiplayer game where you capture as much territory as possible by painting it, or Krunker, a fast-paced game where you fight against rivals from across the world.\n\nOther games with a similar idle vibe include Idle Breakout or casual games like Word Search, 2048, or Bubble Shooter.\n\nFeatures\nEat smaller cells to become bigger\nFast-paced online gameplay\nFour game modes to enjoy\nPlay with your friends\nAgar.io Developer\n\nMatheus Valadares announced Agar.io on 4chan on 28 April 2015.

The game was announced without a name, and users had to connect to Valadares' IP address to play.\n\nIt was only later that the name \"Agar.io\" was suggested by an anonymous user on 4chan. Matheus continued adding new features to the game. One week later, Agar.io entered Steam Greenlight.\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 2015\n\nPlatforms\n\nWeb browser\niOS app\nAndroid app\nLast Updated\n\nJul 19, 2023\n\nControls\nMove mouse = move\nW = eject mass\nSpace = split\nFAQ\nHow do you split in Agar.io?\n\nPress the spacebar to split the cells.\n\nCan you play Agar.io on mobile?\n\nYou can play Agar.io on Android and iOS if you download the official app.\n\nWhat is the oldest IO game?\n\nLaunched on 4chan on 28 April 2015 by Matheus, a 19-year-old Brazilian developer Matheus Valadares, Agario is considered the oldest IO game.\n\nHow to play Agar.io?\n\nIn Agar.io, you control a cell that grows by eating pellets and smaller players while avoiding larger ones.

These low areas might offer protection from enemy fire, but they can also be dangerous ambush zones if enemies are lurking nearby.\n\nWhile your tank can take a few hits, too much damage will destroy it. Once you're taken out, you'll have to restart, so choose your movements carefully and stay alert at all times.\n\nYou can communicate with other players in real time using the chat box located at the bottom of the screen. The leaderboard in the top right corner shows the scores of all players currently in the match, helping you track your progress.\n\nThe minimap on the screen gives you a sense of where enemy tanks are located and how close they are to your position. Use this to plan your attacks or your escape.\n\nYou’ll also see soldiers walking around the map. They’re easy to take out, but they can also act as warnings that an enemy tank might be nearby.\n\nStay alive, shoot fast, and take control before someone else does.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nEnjoy playing io games?

You start with nothing but soon scavenge for weapons, gear, and essential supplies scattered across the map. Every second counts as you battle to stay ahead of the deadly red zone and within the ever-shifting safe zone. Choose to go solo, team up with a partner in duo mode, or join forces with a squad, strategizing your way to outlast up to 50 fierce opponents.\n\nHow to SurvEv.io\n\nYou can play SurvEv.io solo, duo, in a squad, join a team, or create your own team to conquer the battlefield. The goal of this IO game is simple—be the last player standing because there’s no respawn—you only live once per game, so make sure every move counts.\n\nSurvEv.io plays like a 2D version of classic battle royale games such as Fortnite or Apex Legends but with a top-down view and faster pacing. You begin each match empty-handed except for a simple backpack. Scavenge for weapons, ammo, scopes, and medical supplies scattered across the map. They are everywhere, so be prepared to pick them up and use them to defend yourself. To interact with objects around you, press F to pick up items, loot, or revive teammates.\n\nThe object of the game is to eliminate other players to claim their loot. Survival isn’t just about combat—you’ll also need to avoid the deadly red zone. The red zone gradually closes in from the map’s edges and deals increasing damage, so keep moving and stay within the safe zone to survive. You can't hide in the bushes from your enemies for too long. The red zone has no mercy.\n\nThe game also has cool seasonal events, from snowy winter updates with snowballs to throw to spooky Halloween nights filled with mysterious pumpkins that bring either tricks or treats. Anniversary events bring the community together in squad-based challenges, while limited-time modes add variety with thrilling mechanics and surprises. Whether dodging snowballs or exploring the map for hidden weapons like the elusive OTs-38 revolver, each update expands the battlefield with new ways to strategize, loot, and survive.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you want more IO game fun, browse our vast selection of games and enjoy some popular ones like Skribbl.io, a multiplayer drawing game, lolbeans, a multiplayer racing game where you dodge obstacles and outlast other beans in this zany elimination race; or Bonk.io, where you compete with up to eight players to defeat your opponents by pushing them into deadly objects (or off the map).\n\nLast Updated\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nControls\nMovement = W, A, S, D\nAim = Mouse\nMelee/Shoot = Left-Click\nChange Weapons = 1 through 4 or Scroll Wheel\nStow Weapons (Melee Mode) = 3 or E\nSwap to Previous Weapon = Q\nSwitch Gun Slots = T or drag gun to other slot\nReload = R\nScope Zoom = Left-click on Zoom\nPickup/Loot/Revive = F\nUse Medical Item = Left-Click on Item or 7 through 0\nDrop Item = Right-Click on Item\nCancel Action = X\nView Map = M or G\nToggle Minimap = V\nUse Team Ping Wheel = Hold C, then hold Right-Click and drag mouse, then release Right-Click\nUse Emote Wheel = Hold Right-Click and drag the mouse, then release the Right-Click\nFAQ\nWhat is the oldest io game?\n\nA game that is often attributed as being the oldest io game is Agar.io, where you are a simple agar cell fighting to become the largest cell in a multiplayer game arena.\n\nWhat does the io stand for in games?\n\nIo in games stands for input/output.\n\nGameplay Video"

Collect resources to gain experience points (XP) and level up your ship. Each level unlocks new ships and modules—offering unique abilities like mining, attacking, or boosting speed. To equip a module, simply drag it from your inventory into one of your ship’s module slots. Customizing your ship’s loadout allows you to adapt to different strategies and playstyles.\n\nTo climb the leaderboard, you’ll need to build and protect your base. Use the toolbar at the bottom of the screen to access different building types, each with its own cost and function. Make sure you’ve mined enough resources before constructing anything, then drag and drop buildings onto the map grid.\n\nDynamo: The heart of your base, powering nearby tiles when fueled. Click it or drag a resource to it to supply power.\nScorer: Generates leaderboard points over time, but only when powered by a nearby Dynamo.\nTurrets: Automatically defend your base against enemies, but require power to function.\nWalls: Strong, low-cost defenses ideal for protecting your core structures.\n\nStay alert! Other players can attack your base at any time! If your ship is destroyed, you’ll lose everything: your modules, inventory, and progress. On the flip side, defeating other players earns you valuable XP.\n\nStrategy Tips\nFocus on leveling up your ship first before building a base. A stronger ship makes resource collection faster and safer.\nExperiment with modules. You can freely swap them out to match your current objectives.\nUse the edges of the map as natural defenses for your base, but keep in mind that resources are scarcer there.\n\nMaster resource management, smart base-building, and tactical ship upgrades to become the top pilot in Voxorp!\n\nLast Updated\n\nOct 28, 2025\n\nControls\nWASD / arrow keys = move around\nHold the left mouse button on resources = mine resources\nDrag the left mouse button = drag modules from your inventory into your ship"

With a multitude of levels to explore, each one introduces new challenges and exciting obstacles that test your creativity and strategic thinking. Draw your way to victory and see how far your creativity can take you!\n\nHow to Play Doodle Road\n\nYou start in Doodle Road by practicing drawing a straight line from the car to the target. Sounds simple, right? Wait until you see how straight your line really is! The true challenge is how easy it is for your car actually to drive across that path.\n\nNext challenge – draw a line to the target, but now there's a wall in your way. Remember, your car can’t fly! So, think about how to draw your path – you don’t have to go over the wall; you can go under it! As you go, you'll see that drawing a straight line is harder than it looks. If you don’t start the line from behind your car, it’ll just dangle off into oblivion.\n\nHow do you get over an L-shape? Or a huge gap in the ground? And the challenges keep coming. By level 5, your engine shuts off, so you’ll need your physics brain to figure out how to use hills and momentum to get across.\n\nSome levels have trampoline-like springs that’ll launch you toward your target. The challenges change each time, keeping you on your toes. Buckle up because it's going to be a bumpy ride, depending on how well you draw!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThe fun has just begun!

Each game tests your timing, balance, and quick thinking. The game begins by letting you choose from a set of different obstacle-based modes, each with its own style and surprises.\n\nYou’ll face multiple rounds of challenges, such as:\n\nRed Light, Green Light: The classic stop-and-go test. Run when the light is green, freeze when it’s red. Move at the wrong time, and you’re out.\n\nCarousel Round: Follow the instructions: “run into a room,” “get into groups of two or three,” or “go solo.” It sounds simple, but without a way to communicate with other players, teamwork becomes tricky and tense.\n\nSkywalk Courses: Balance across oversized objects floating in the sky—giant coffee cups, donuts, chocolate bars, and more. One misstep and you’ll tumble straight down, ending your round.\n\nOther modes keep the action fresh, from racing down twisting bike tracks to sneaking through prison breakouts. Each one pushes you to react quickly and stay sharp under pressure.\n\nThe controls are simple, but the levels demand precision. One moment you’re leaping across glowing rainbow platforms, the next you’re dodging traps or trying to outsmart guards. Success depends on timing, agility, and a little creativity in how you approach obstacles.\n\nWith colorful environments, unpredictable twists, and nonstop movement, Obby World: Squid Escape is built for players who want parkour challenges that keep them on their toes.\n\nChoose your mode. In Rainbow Mode, you’ll dash across glowing platforms in a lively, colorful world. Bicycle Mode shifts the challenge to two wheels, where speed, stunts, and sharp maneuvers keep the race intense. Prison Escape raises the stakes with traps to dodge, guards to evade, and clever moves needed to break free. Each mode has its own style of thrill, and requires quick reflexes and sharp timing. Between games, you can personalize your character with outfits and accessories, giving your hero a distinct look.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like the wild antics of this game, you may like games like Eggy Car, where you have to navigate an egg in a car through obstacles, ensuring it doesn't crack!

Your mission is to evolve your character into an unstoppable force by unlocking powerful upgrades, mastering epic combos, and unleashing devastating fatalities that will destroy your foes. Conquer waves of enemies with precision and skill as you dominate each battle. Only after crushing every opponent will you unlock the portal to the next level, where even more significant challenges await. Sharpen your reflexes, perfect your strategies, and prove you have what it takes.\n\nHow to Play Stick Epic Fighter\n\nYou begin in a classic arcade-style side-scrolling screen, where you’ll quickly get accustomed to the game’s controls. Use the up arrow to jump, the down arrow to attack, and the left and right arrows for movement. Before long, you’ll encounter enemies—attack them by holding the down arrow to unleash a series of sword strikes. Holding down the attack key continuously lets you deliver multiple hits, which is essential since enemies require several strikes to be defeated.\n\nThough you can jump and sprint past enemies to reach the end of the level quickly, you won’t be able to progress to the next round until all foes are eliminated. If you leave any behind, you’ll have to backtrack and take them out. Once every enemy is defeated, and you reach the final portal, your stickman will celebrate with a happy dance, signaling that you’ve successfully cleared the level!\n\nAs you advance, the difficulty ramps up with more enemies and tougher challenges, so stay alert and fast on your feet! Use the arrows for guidance on enemy locations and areas you may have missed. Throughout the course, prompts will also direct you to jump to high platforms or descend into lower areas.\n\nEach round rewards you with points that can be used to purchase upgrades, boosting your power and making it easier to defeat stronger enemies. Plus, you can customize your stickman by changing skins, giving your hero a fresh look as you fight your way through each increasingly intense round!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nKeep the fun coming.

Navigate through thrilling levels, jumping over gaps and dodging obstacles. Get ready for an adrenaline rush as you tackle exciting challenges on your way to victory!\n\nHow to Play Crazy Motorcycle\n\nCrazy Motorcycle combines Minecraft graphics with classic 80s arcade gameplay. Your movements are limited to left, right, up, down, and jumping. Simple but all crucial to your survival on this obstacle-ridden bike course. You also have control over the sound being on or off. Ah, the good old days were when choice was more tangible. The lack of frills is no measure of fun in this thrilling bike race in the sky.\n\nThere are four available worlds to play in, with different terrains and obstacles in each of them. In every world, there are 16 stages to complete before getting to the end.\n\nThe object of the game is to reach the finish line while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards to fatten your final score. You will mainly be going straight with the occasional moves to the right and left to avoid hitting obstacles or, worse, meeting your fate with the abyss below you by falling off the race track.\n\nYou can't get away with a straight run, and even on level one, you must maneuver to avoid falling to your demise.\n\nThe race course is also not entirely linear, and there are breaks in the course with nothing below you but chance. This is where your jumps will come into play. The wider the gap, the more speed and jump you will need to cross the divide.\n\nIf you see a series of swerving roads ahead with moving obstacles, slow down to retain your balance and avoid getting knocked off the road. The key to moving items is to move with them, even if you get close to the edge. Not all items can be jumped over.\n\nGrab the red flags along the road; they represent checkpoints and allow you to restart from there should you fall, while yellow flags let you collect coins, which you can use to buy new voxelated skins in the menu.\n\nLastly, you can compete against other players by checking your score against theirs in the leaderboard, also available in the main menu.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nBuckle up or wear your helmet and check out more of our driving games!

It combines high-speed thrills with a test of precision and timing across 22 adrenaline-filled levels. Each course introduces fresh, intense obstacles from gravity-defying loops to dangerous ramps and explosive traps that keep you on the edge of your seat. Gear up, strap on your helmet, and prepare to perform stunts of a lifetime as you race against the clock.\n\nHow to Play Moto X3M\n\nSit back, hold on tight, and get ready for a thrilling bike ride (with pretty exciting music). Each level of Moto X3M ramps up the thrill with increasingly complex obstacles that require precision, skill, and, above all, patience. Don't get too distracted by the fun; every mistake comes at a price, and that price is time. And time is the key to nailing the coveted 3-star rating, where only the fastest, cleanest runs bring you victory.\n\nMastering each level means finding that sweet spot between speed, braking, and stunt work, all while dodging obstacles designed to slow you down.\n\nMoto X3M offers 22 distinct tracks, each progressively challenging. While the early levels ease you, later tracks become obstacle-filled gauntlets of ramps, loops, and hazards. With each track’s unique layout, there’s plenty of replay value as you strive to beat your best time. The game can get pretty addictive.\n\nAs you conquer each course, you will earn stars and can use them to unlock two new bikes! It’s more than just a visual upgrade; new bikes give you added motivation to return to tracks and push for faster times and higher scores.\n\nMoto X3M features vibrant 2D graphics, fluid physics-based animation, and a playful, slapstick tone. Crashes are humorous, with ragdoll physics and cartoon-style explosions keeping the action lighthearted. Each track has its own theme, from sunny beaches to underground caves, while energetic music and sound effects heighten the thrill of racing and performing stunts.\n\nPush your speed to the max, but don't rush into unknown obstacles without caution. Every fall adds seconds, impacting your star rating. Aim to squeeze in as many air stunts as you can over big jumps to shave precious seconds off your final time!\n\nAdvanced Moves\nFlips & Combos: Chain flips on long jumps to reduce your final time.\nBack Wheel Boost: Landing on your rear wheel at the right angle gives a speed boost.\nTimer Delay Trick: Wait for the perfect moment to start moving and effectively pause the timer.\nHidden Shortcuts: Some levels allow creative routes to bypass obstacles or save time.\nGame Levels\n\nLevels unlock sequentially, growing in difficulty from beginner-friendly ramps to extreme obstacles. Stars earned on each level unlock new bikes, adding visual variety and motivation to replay tracks. Checkpoints prevent frustration, letting you retry tricky sections without restarting the entire level.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nKeep your wheels on the ground for maximum speed when needed, but don’t hesitate to brake approaching tricky obstacles.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are many games in the Moto X3M series, like Basketball Legends and Basketball Stars.

Play with other people from around the world, or with your friends in one of the many challenging yet wacky game modes.\n\nHow to Play Mr. Dude: Online Multiverse Challenge\n\nYou’ll need to wait in each game mode until enough other players are found to join you. You don’t directly interact with them, but you can get inspired by their moves.\n\nChoose your mode:\n\nRandom Map\nColored Floor (Disco Version)\nDangerous Bridge\nEscape (From Hell!)\nPanic Room (Horror Movie Style)\nDisco Mode\n\nIn Disco, a colorful floor awaits, but every few seconds, most of the colors disappear. If you are standing on a tile that is gone, the bouncers will fling you off the dance floor. Collect as many coins as possible while staying on the safe colors.\n\nDangerous Bridge Mode\n\nCross the bridge in various settings: a construction site, a rooftop, or an island with shark-infested waters below. One wrong move and it's game over. Make precise jumps and do not rush until you have built confidence.\n\nHell Mode\n\nStart on a stone slab with molten lava flowing beneath you. Jump across other slabs while avoiding the lava unless you want to stay in hell for eternity.\n\nHorror Movie Mode\n\nThis mode places you in a seemingly normal home, but it is anything but normal. You must find the key to escape. You have 10 seconds to search without anyone chasing you. If you take longer, a villain on a bicycle will start chasing you. If they catch you, it is game over. Interact with objects using the E key.\n\nRandom\n\nThis mode sends you to any one of the games above.\n\nThis multiplayer game is perfect for playing with players worldwide or with friends and family. Want to play with friends? Access private rooms to keep the game among familiar faces.\n\nTip\n\nYou’ll receive a suitcase full of daily rewards. Spin the Wheel of Fortune to see what gift you get. Gifts can include coins, dynamite, shoes with a bit of extra pep, lifelines, and more.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWe have plenty more games with a similar vibe in our casual collection.

You control a sneaky thief’s hand as it reaches for valuable treasures, but the path is filled with complex traps, laser security systems, and tricky obstacles. Do you have what it takes to outsmart each trap that comes your way?\n\nHow to Play Thief Puzzle\n\nIn Thief Puzzle, you're tasked with a series of sneaky heists in various comical settings. You'll start by testing your skills in simple situations: snatching a purse from an old woman seated on a bench or grabbing groceries from two unsuspecting women from a ledge. As you progress, the challenges escalate. You’ll even swipe a tourist’s suitcase while they admire the Eiffel Tower and outwit a rival thief to steal a money bag in a museum. There’s never a dull moment as you navigate your way through each clever scenario.\n\nFrom beachside schemes where you steal a pearl from a shell to slipping into restricted areas by pickpocketing a key, every level brings new surprises. As the difficulty increases, you’ll find yourself pulling off trickier moves like swiping a diamond ring from a newly engaged couple while they’re lost in a kiss or lifting answers from a classmate’s test without getting caught by whirling fans. You’ll also have to outsmart guard dogs to steal car keys, drive away with precision, avoid TNT explosions, and—just for fun—snatch a toupee from the head of a party guest.\n\nAs the levels progress, you will need increasing sharp thinking and precise timing as you carefully plot your moves to avoid detection and snatch the prize. With every stage growing more challenging, you'll need to outwit elaborate defenses using clever strategies and creative solutions.\n\nSharp thinking alone won't cut it. You will need to calculate the perfect angles and find the shortest path to avoid detection. The puzzles are designed to challenge your wit and timing, requiring you to navigate obstacles and interact with dynamic environments. The slightest misstep could alert your target or trigger traps, so precision is key as you outmaneuver everything from dogs, furniture, and, of course, unsuspecting victims.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nWant a few more brain-teasing games to get you scratching your head?

Stay alert as other players may try to steal your progress, adding an exciting twist to the challenge. Strategize and race to complete your bridge first in this thrilling test of skill and speed!\n\nHow to Play Bridge Race\n\nBridge Race is an oddly satisfying game where you aim to collect as many blocks of your color as possible and carry them across the board to build a bridge. The objective is to create a path that leads you to the next collection area and, ultimately, to the finish line. Victory is sweet, but the challenge continues as each round gets more difficult.\n\nThe game is designed to be both simple and rewarding, with delicate sounds that create a satisfying atmosphere. You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.\n\nBut you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nUnwind and keep the fun going with some of our most popular casual games, including another music category title called Blob Opera, a game that uses a machine learning model trained on authentic voices to make it easy for anyone to create amazing operatic music.

Learn to pick them up quickly, and watch out for bats, swords, shields, dynamite, and potions that boost your size and power.\n\nAt the end of each round, you’ll need to project yourself into an elevator to get to the next round, but it won’t open until you’ve defeated every enemy on the level.

Your goal is to get the highest score on each round, because at the end of the level, you will get a chance to shoot a giant monster. The higher your score, the more power you gain.\n\nHow to Play Man Runner 2048\n\nYour ultimate goal is to merge men to reach the 2048 level, achieve the highest score possible, and then fire powerful cannonballs to damage giant monsters and take control of the islands.\n\nEach course starts pretty simply. You will need to run through a course head-on, filled with obstacles, while collecting as many points as possible. The gamescape is set up like a runway, and obstacles are everywhere. They could be right in front of you, coming from below, dropping from above. Stay vigilant and keep your eye on the prize. You want to make it to the end of the course.\n\nAlong the way, collect green rewards and pink diamonds for significant score boosts, but steer clear of anything red or items that split your points. At the end of the course, you will face a giant skeleton. Aim carefully to hit your target. Experiment to find its Achilles’ heel, sometimes right between the eyes, works for maximum damage to earn extra points. You may not be able to defeat it right away, but each attempt helps you rack up a higher score.\n\nEach round introduces new obstacles, including sliding floors that can help you gather more points if you move skillfully. Be careful of spikes that rise from the ground and bombs that drop from the sky, both of which can cost you the run.\n\nBetween runs, you can buy accessories to customize your character.\n\nTip\n\nAim for the monster's center when you fire your cannonballs at the end of the round. This is one of its weakest spots.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nIf you like Man Runner 20248, you will want to browse our casual category for similar fun.

There is a serene exhilaration of soaring when you get the hang of the controls, but it doesn't last long. You need to land! Every flight pushes your skills to the limit as you navigate unpredictable terrains and intense weather conditions. Will you make a smooth touchdown or end in a spectacular, fiery crash?\n\nHow to Play Crazy Plane Landing\n\nYour main objective in Crazy Plane Landing is to take flight, avoid obstacles, and land your plane safely. This sounds easy enough, but there is a reason some airline pilots need over a thousand hours of flight time for certification. It isn't easy!\n\nYou’ll need to master both acceleration and steering with simple game gears—hold the left mouse button, space bar, W key, or up arrow to accelerate and gain altitude, giving your plane just enough speed to soar through the skies. As you navigate, use the left mouse button or the left and right arrow keys to steer your plane on course. There are arrows pointing to the destination landing strip. Take your hand off the acceleration and steer towards the landing pad.\n\nPrecision is key—smoothly adjust your trajectory to avoid obstacles and line up your approach for a perfect landing. The right balance between speed and direction will ensure a safe landing. Don't expect too many smooth landings to begin with. This game is called \"crazy\" for a reason.\n\nYou have a few airplanes to choose from but can only upgrade once you've accumulated a significant amount of points. Upgrades are well worth all the crashes that get you accumulated points. You not only get to choose your plane, but you can upgrade engines, boosts, and bonuses.\n\nThe better the plane, the more control you have over your speed and steering.\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nThere are plenty more driving games to continue the fun.

Start small with just a handful of planes and airports, then strategically expand by treating travelers to lavish VIP lounges, purchasing state-of-the-art planes, and expanding to international airports. Like most management games, you can't do all the work yourself. Hire skilled managers to automate your flights, upgrade your fleet to maximize efficiency, and ensure top-tier passenger satisfaction. Unlock powerful bonuses and climb the ranks to airline tycoon!\n\nHow to Play Airline Tycoon Idle\n\nYour objective in Idle Airline Tycoon is to transform a small operation into a global airline fleet. Start with a modest amount of airplanes, two to be exact, with limited destinations, but soon you'll be connecting dozens of cities worldwide.\n\nGameplay is simple and made to keep you engaged (and relaxed!) as you click your fleet to take off as often as possible, driving up revenue and unlocking more upgrades. Fly as much as you can, and you will soon find yourself upgrading your airports and planes to gradually grow your airline empire.\n\nPurchasing a new airplane will set you back around $5,000, but it's a crucial step in expanding your airline. To gather the necessary funds, you'll need to fly your planes to the initial routes offered, like Rome, London, and New York, running consistent flights to build up your earnings. The goal is to master these routes and venture into new cities, steadily growing your airline’s reach. Every flight you run brings you closer to unlocking more destinations,\n\nEach choice you make shapes your airline’s success—expand air routes, optimize flight paths, and invest in airport upgrades to attract more passengers and increase your earnings.\n\nThe game combines strategy with the ease of idle gameplay, allowing you to earn profits with a click. But don’t just sit back—efficient management is key. Carefully plan your routes between cities to ensure smooth operations and steady profits, avoiding costly mistakes that could disrupt your flights.\n\nBon voyage!\n\nMore Games Like This\n\nClicker games are the perfect way to unwind.
